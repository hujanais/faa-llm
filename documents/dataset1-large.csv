Normal taxi; We departed Runway XX ZZZ. As TO power applied we began to notice burning oil smell on flight deck. I thought about rejecting but it was not my leg and this is not an uncommon thing and dissipates once engines are at pores for a moment. Continued TO and after rotation fumes continued and seemed to increase. Out of 1500 I told ZZZ Tower Controller we were having a fume event and needed an immediate return. I did not declare emergency since there was no visible smoke. We were handed to ZZZ TRACON Departure; turned at 3000 ft. Downwind for Runway XY. I dinged Cabin and asked if they smelled anything; the response was no. I told them we would be returning to ZZZ and they had 10 minutes; let me know if they see anything. During this time odor continued. Didn't get any better. We accomplished after After TO ck; cruz; descent ck and a quick set up and brief of ILS Runway XY. weather was CAVOK. We were over landing weight and deployed Gear and flaps in downwind to burn fuel. I did a rough and dirty calc and figured we would be at landing weight at touchdown. I sent acars to Dispatch and called gate freq in ZZZ to tell them we would need a gate right away.   FO (First Officer) landed perfectly smooth touch. I noted we had touched at 450# over MAX landing weight.  We taxied to fast to gate. I started APU for electric and shut down the Left engine and the result was increase in fumes. We pulled into gate and shut down RH engine and went on APU air. The fumes subsided and I suspect it was the RH engine dumping oil into the bleed air to the pack. Maintenance arrived and Mechanic said he smelled the oil as he entered the plane. Post flight I spoke with ALL the flight attendants and the rear positions said they had strong fumes. The #1 on call said there were no fumes. Some people simply have bad smell? IDK.  A cursery review of the aircraft past history indicated high oil consumption of the RH engine. I had noted this and it was included in my preflight threat assessment briefing to the FO. I did not declare an emergency as the traffic at the airport was not heavy and my priority was getting on the ground ASAP. It was extremely high workload and I commend the FO for the teamwork. I think we covered the bases and actually had to extend the downwind an extra minute to get finished. The Tower was aware of the situation and I assume an alert 1 was issued. I felt further distraction of declaration was not helpful. I fully blame Company maintenance procedures for not identifying and repairing the high oil consumption on the RH engine. They dispatched an aircraft with an ongoing defect. Jets are not Piston engines and high oil consumption should not be deferred and dispatched.Tricresyl phosphate when burned and introduced into cabin can kill. The Airline has a fume event reporting policy and has taken adequate steps to report the downline event reporting. I feel Maintenance diminishes the serious nature of fumes in the cabin. This aircraft should have not been dispatched with high oil burn.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain reported a burning oil odor during takeoff and initial climb which prompted the flight crew to request an immediate return to departure airport.

The following is a narrative of events in a linear flow but during the event a lot was happening at the same time.During cruise at FL360; Captain; PF (Pilot Flying); we had an Autopilot Disconnect Warning. I grabbed the yolk and throttles and checked PFD. Captain's PFD showed we were white across the board. Manual on speed; altitude and heading. We were in a slight decent and airspeed was slowing into the lower ft. FO (First Officer) was showing slight decent and airspeed increasing. I made the statement it looked like Airspeed Unreliable. We then had Multiple Level 2 Alerts pop up. We then started to get Over Speed Warnings. We determined that it looked like the FO's info was the more accurate and I slowed down just enough to discontinue the Over Speed Warning. Captain's Airspeed was continuing to decrease (showing 180 kts). I directed the FO to look at the first few steps of one of the 3 Level 2 Alerts. I said the checklist should have a statement that if we have the 3 Level 2 alerts showing it is an Airspeed Unreliable. We confirmed that was correct and started the Airspeed Unreliable checklist.At some point ATC called us and we confirmed we were having major issues. We told them we were correcting to altitude and course. We also said we would get back to them.While the FO started the checklist I was back on altitude and trying to correct to course. I was having trouble getting on course. I then realized that my side was commanding a heading to course based on incorrect winds. My airspeed was down to 80 kts. and showing a wind out of the southeast at over 200 kts. FO was showing winds near flight planned approximately 180 degrees and 120 kts. I contacted ATC and told them we were lost a lot of info and would like a heading. He gave us a heading and offered ZZZ for the nearest airport. I told him we would get back to him.During the Airspeed Unreliable checklist; it showed that our aircraft was equipped with an AUX CADC. Per the checklist we selected it to the Captain's Side. We finished the checklist and got back almost everything we had lost except: SEL FADEC ALT Level 2 was still showing on all 3 engines. We ran the QRH and corrected that Warnings.The only Warning still showing was an ALT Comparator Alert. We discussed the weather at ZZZ1 and felt that with weather at 1;500 ft. we could make a safe ILS approach. Captain's; FO's and Standby Altimeter were all with in 150 ft.We then contacted Dispatch and told them what we had. We also confirmed with them our plan to continue to ZZZ. They saw no problems with continuing to ZZZ.",,"During cruise at FL360; the Autopilot disconnected. Captain was Pilot Flying and grabbed the controls. My instruments showed us in a descent with increasing airspeed. Captain's instruments were showing a descent and his airspeed was decreasing. Captain said that it looked like an unreliable airspeed. My instruments started showing an overspeed condition; and we started getting the associated warning with that. We also had multiple level 2 Alerts displayed so I started the checklist for the Select FADEC ALT (The first Level 2 Alert displayed); which along with the other Level 2 Alerts; directed me to the Unreliable Airspeed checklist; which I began. At that time we determined that it was my side's instruments that were correct; due to their correlation to the standby instruments. The Captain's Airspeed Indication dropped to as low as 90 kts. Captain then slowed down to stop the Over Speed. ATC queried us about being off on our altitude and I told them that we were working an instrumentation issue but we were working on getting back on course and altitude and we would get back with them. Captain was trying to maintain course towards the fix; but because of his incorrect data we were not going the right direction. We requested a heading assignment from ATC while we continued to work the issue; which they gave us. At some point around this time; ATC offered us ZZZ as the nearest airport if we needed to divert. The checklist directed us to switch the AUX CADC to the Captain's side. When we did that his airspeed data returned to normal. The Select FADEC ALTN level 2 Alert was still Illuminated; so we ran that checklist and it cleared the Alert. We were able to get back on course and reengage the Autopilot after that. The only remaining issue was an Altitude Comparison Advisory; because there was about a 150 ft. difference between my and the Captain's Altitude reading. We discussed how to proceed and neither one of us thought that the small altitude split would prevent safely continuing to ZZZ1; so we continued. We contacted company as well and they saw no issue with continuing on to ZZZ1. Remainder of the flight continued without incident.I believe this event was caused by the Captain's pitot tube becoming blocked by ice crystals; as we were in the tops of clouds at high altitude for an extended period of time. This caused the loss of useful airspeed data on his side; which caused the autopilot disconnect; leading the Captain to attempt to maintain proper speed; course and altitude with bad airspeed data.",,"MD-11 flight crew reported an Autopilot Disconnect Warning in cruise. This was followed by numerous Airspeed Warnings. The flight crew ran the QRH and elected to continue to destination airport.",

On the climb out (900 ft. AGL) the PM (Pilot Monitoring) IRS system completely failed. The PF (Pilot Flying) (mine) IRS continued to operate for a bit but also eventually failed and disconnected the Auto Pilot. We alerted departure to the loss of instrumentation and requested a vector. Using the magnetic compass and standby ISI we leveled off at 5;000 ft. and flew the vector. Shortly after we requested a climb to 10;000 ft. to leave the IMC conditions and to better run our QRH/Checklist. We soon realized the failure and decided that a return to ZZZ was the best option. The clouds were high enough for an eventual visual approach. ATC gave us a no gyro approach until we were able to get the ILS GS and then runway insight to land. Upon landing there was no further action required beyond returning to a gate and alerting Maintenance. We are unsure of the cause for the failure. The only reason we had to return is both systems fully failed.There is not much we can do about the failure.

As instructor; I immediately informed Tower traffic was in sight and currently was passing directly over top of us. The high wing Cessna had departed the parallel runway; Runway 30R; on an extended upwind and just entering left traffic ahead of us; per ATC; but appeared to have continued their turn from upwind to downwind instead of flying a crosswind leg. Tower did inform the high wing Cessna after passing they had to widen their downwind because they turned into upwind traffic on the parallel. No other conflicts occurred. From my position in the low wing Piper; the high wing Cessna appeared to be about 400 feet above us when passing over top.As a result; I discussed with my student that even though we both were listening to the ATC Traffic advisory and scanning for that traffic; to not let that interrupt our situational awareness of traffic on the parallel runway. Despite this incident both aircraft being on same frequency; it is possible they can be on different frequencies. Both the student and instructor learned about the requirements of situational awareness; and to yes look for traffic ATC points out; but keep that scan going being careful not to expect to see that traffic cross in front of us. While we were still on our straight out instruction from ATC initially; situational awareness is key with parallel runways; especially at airports where it is common for ATC to assign that aircraft left traffic for that runway even though it doesn't follow published pattern directions. It's still possible for traffic to cross ahead of or behind you in the crosswind legs. My student and I were able to take the appropriate actions to avoid any further loss of separation and avoid a collision after visually acquiring the traffic.",,,,"GA instructor pilot reported an NMAC with another aircraft in the pattern which did not follow ATC instructions.",

The icing was a result of rain from the previous day that had frozen over night. I would like to emphasize that all of the ice was removed during the pre-flight phase.During takeoff; after rotating and becoming airborne; and while increasing airspeed; there was a violent fluttering of the flight controls observed that negatively affected the controllability of the aircraft. The effects were severe enough that I do not believe that we would have been able to successfully complete an entire lap in the traffic pattern to land back at the airport. Fortunately; the runway was long enough that we were able to make a successful landing on the remaining runway and terminate the flight without further incident.It was concluded after the flight that the most likely cause was that some of the rain from the day before had made its way into some of the flight control surfaces and caused the fluttering once we reached a high enough airspeed for the imbalance to cause the fluttering. After temperatures warmed up above freezing; the airplane was flown again without issue.My biggest issue with this occurrence is that there is really no way to check for icing inside of the control surfaces on any airplane that I have ever flown. As far as I'm aware; the only way to detect this issue is to fly the airplane and observe the fluttering. Proper corrective action if this is observed in the future would be to abort the takeoff; if able; and if unable to abort; reduce to an airspeed that prevents the fluttering and return to land at or below that particular airspeed.",,,,"Instructor pilot reported violent flight control fluttering after takeoff and elected to land on the remaining runway rather than chance a flight around the pattern.

During the engine run up; I had my student help me hold the brakes to keep from rolling. After the run up; we were instructed to taxi to Runway XXL via Taxiway XX for departure. The airplane taxied normally; and we departed without incident.Upon returning to the airport; wind conditions increased significantly. We departed with winds 150 at 10 to return with winds 160 at 13G26. I elected to use 10 degrees of flaps and approach at 75-80 kts. instead of the typical 30 degrees of flaps and 65 kts. airspeed. The airplane was moving too quickly to safely stop and make Taxiway XY; so I rolled down to the end of the runway. The airplane made the right turn safely and we taxied back to parking via Taxiway XX. Taxiway XY was the first entrance to the ramp; and that was the entrance I was planning on using.At this moment; the left brake pedal on my side (right side of the airplane) had no pressure on the pedal and was doing nothing to slow the airplane down. The airplane turns with differential brake pressure; to which I had none to make this turn. I asked my student to get on the brakes on the left side to help me; but that was too little too late. We departed the pavement and stopped in the grass short of a taxiway sign; but not before clipping the blue taxiway marker light with the propeller. Miraculously; only the propeller was damaged; and only slightly.

I was on another screen and took a few seconds to switch to the airport map to identify where this traffic was coming from because I had accidentally inhibited the traffic alert popup; which brings attention to the traffic conflict. By the time I got to the map screen; I see a Bonanza on the display with tail number Aircraft Y coming from my right; approximately 750 ft. horizontally and 150 ft. below my aircraft (my iPad stated 200 ft.; which indicates an ads-b calculated range of 151 ft. to 250 ft.). At this moment; I take controls from the student and start a steep turn to the right. By the time this aircraft passed us; it was within 75 ft. horizontally and still 150 ft. below. After this incident; the pilot of the Bonanza had cut off a Diamond DA-20 aircraft on final; with an even closer; near miss of what was definitely less than 1;000 ft. (this Instructor later contacted me; and I found out the Bonanza was an estimated 300-500 ft. horizontally and 0 ft. vertically from his aircraft).

I was inbound ZZZ Runway XX from the east at a bearing of approximately 270 when setting sun made it difficult to see as I prepared to merge on the downwind. I glanced down at ADS-B to note 4 planes on downwind with a 5th to the south east of the field; unknown destination. I did not see planes on the upwind either visually or on ADSB. Poor horizontal visibility; blinding glare; good vertical visibility. I could not see the planes on downwind and was unclear about the plane to the SE intentions. This made making a tear drop or 360 to merge into the downwind a poor choice since I would again be blinded in the turn with known traffic in the area. The radio frequency was overloaded with many airports reporting on XXX.XX. I had announced inbound 15 and 5 miles and heard a plane was 10 miles west of the field with no stated intentions. Due to unknown status of planes but an ADSB visual on downwind; I announced and climbed 500 ft. above TPA to cross midfield; not realizing that I would be blinded by the setting sun. Airport borders on ZZZ1 Bravo to the north making crossing mid-field best option. I was blinded crossing midfield but maintained altitude and heading. Apparently another plane was also crossing midfield from the west but did not announce until he nearly missed me. He could see me as the sun was to his back; however; I was blinded and attempted to maintain altitude and heading. Between XA30 and XB41 there were 29 patterns flown inclusive of touch and goes to Runway XX at ZZZ. On review of flight aware tracks this included a possible training flight that made a 360 turn left flying upwind in downwind traffic to re-enter the downwind traffic east of the field. In addition; with numerous unclear; unnecessary calls on CTAF; it would not be possible to either make or understand radio calls to establish situational awareness of 11 planes making 30 landings either for final or touch and go. In retrospect after discussion with other pilots; the pilot who was with me; and including CFIs; a turn 180 to remove myself from the pattern was a possibility to reenter at a later time might have been the best options. Given that all flight schools in the area were very busy on the lovely day; it may not have been better at ZZZ2 or ZZZ3. Multiple touch and goes in busy landing traffic without consistent and accurate radio calls and an overloaded frequency were big contributing factors.",,,,"Flight Instructor reported an NMAC event while attempting to enter a crowed landing pattern.",

A Cessna (Aircraft Y) was ahead of us (we were in Diamond Aircraft X) when a Bonanza (Aircraft Z) entered the pattern on a left base within a couple hundred ft. of the Cessna; completely cutting them off - to the point that they had to deviate around them. The first call Aircraft Z made was left base for [Runway] XX (after the first close call); and at the time there was an additional Cessna shooting an approach on a 3 mile final. The final traffic announced where they were again and the Bonanza executed a missed approach into the upwind; and rejoined the pattern. By the time both the Cessna traffic landed we were on a 1.5 mile final having reported base and final on CTAF. The Bonanza traffic was making minimal radio calls; and when they called left base XX I saw that they were coming right at us looking at traffic map (0 ft. difference in altitude and all I could tell was that they were within .25 miles horizontally). I immediately took controls from my student; added full power and executed a climbing steep turn to the right. When I finally saw the aircraft; they were passing under us around 300 ft. away. They were on collision course and would have been in our flight path had I not taken evasive action. I asked the Bonanza traffic if they had us in sight and they did not until we were parallel and in the upwind. After re-entering the pattern and landing I obtained their tail number.In the matter of 10 minutes this pilot managed to cut off three different aircraft (all of which had flight instructors present) with possibly two near mid-air collisions. This pilot seriously lacks situational awareness. He also entered the pattern improperly - especially with it being busy; and did not make a sufficient amount of radio calls.",,"When on a training flight with an Instructor we were on a downwind approach that was slightly extended from our usual.

He promptly took the flight controls and exercised a avoidance maneuver to extend the distance between the two aircraft. While I am confident that if both aircraft trajectories were maintained a collision would not have occurred the encounter was so close that a slight deviation in either aircraft trajectories would have resulted in a catastrophic event. The operator of the other aircraft had entered in a abnormal fashion; best described as; Assuming that my frame of reference as 0 degrees from a top down perspective (In line with my aircraft); the pilot in question entered at ~60 degrees to the right at about 100 ft. below us flying level. While my memory of the closest part of the encounter is at best blurry; It was still apparent to me and my Instructor that this encounter was unreasonable.

I was wrong. The pilot descended to 6600 ft. in a 072 ft. MVA.  By the time I noticed; he was exiting the 7200 ft. MVA and entering a 6200 ft. MVA. The 6200 ft. being safe for his present altitude of 6400 ft. thus I did not issue a terrain safety alert. At that point I vectored him toward destination and told him to maintain 6200 ft.And I inquired what he was assigned previously.  Pilot said he was cleared by previous Controller 'direct ZZZ VOR and assigned 6400 ft. which doesn't make any sense of why the previous Controller would do that.  An assignment of 6400 ft. would drop below at least two higher MVA's. Not sure how this all began; but it was not safe.  I take part in the blame; I should have inquired; instead of assuming.

The entry to the downwind was inefficient for the pilot since they were coming from the north and added workload to the Tower that seemed unnecessary. I instructed the aircraft to make a straight in entry to Runway XX. I scanned the final to make sure it would not impact the approach. The only other aircraft was Aircraft Y estimated about 13 to 14 miles north for an instrument VFR approach. As Aircraft X continued inbound; they descended to 1700 ft. at about 80 to 90 kts. Aircraft Y was observed at 180 kts. and no slowing down. The separation on final quickly reduced to 3 miles and then even less. When I realized that Aircraft Y was not slowing down; I was not in contact with the pilot yet. I instructed Aircraft X to make a turn southwest and plan for a right downwind entry because of the faster traffic not slowing down behind him. Aircraft Y still maintained 180 kts. at around 5 to 6 mile final; so I instructed Aircraft X to turn westbound to ensure they were clear of final for the fast moving aircraft. Aircraft Y was observed breaking off of final at 2000 ft.; westbound in the same direction as Aircraft X. Aircraft Y passed just above and behind of Aircraft X at a fast rate of speed. I did not have a chance to issue the traffic to Aircraft X since the move of Aircraft Y was sudden and unexpected; also the Aircraft Y was behind Aircraft X. The pilot of Aircraft X spotted Aircraft Y after the aircraft was safely ahead and to the right.A recent change has been made to allow Approach to put single engine VFR aircraft into the midfield downwinds without coordination to allow more efficient sequencing of aircraft and alleviate some workload for Approach. The fact is that Approach allows aircraft into runway departure corridors and ships aircraft that should be sequenced straight in to the runway and do not instruct aircraft to enter the midfield downwind; nor do they vector them to a point to allow for that to happen.Since the change numerous aircraft have been observed entering the departure corridors at 2200 ft. on heading usable by the Tower to put Jets on; which climb to 3000 ft. Also aircraft; like on the Runway XX operation are switched to Tower north of the field tagged as left and right downwinds because it easier to get rid of them; but they should be sequenced with their traffic. The new downwind procedure should not happen until there is a clear understanding.",,,,"A Tower Controller reported they turned an aircraft off of the final approach course due to being overtaken by traffic on TRACON frequency.

This was also very surprising as the weather was good for meeting the minimums; and no one else had gone around for quite some time; except the previous arrival Aircraft Y. There was also a consistent crosswind however no wind shear of any kind reported. They were given go around instructions and read them back. They were given go around instructions; read them back; and Local coordinated with TRACON. When the Controller asked the pilot for the reason; they also stated terrain warning. The go around was coordinated with Clearance. There was no Low Altitude alert generated from the surveillance equipment.In this case; there was Aircraft Z that had been waiting for departure to cross XXL and depart XXR. I told the Local Controller to coordinate 3;000 ft. with TRACON with the go arounds at 4;000 ft. and launch them XXL beneath the others; as they were a northeast departure and the go arounds would be turned to a south downwind. This was successfully accomplished; albeit a little hesitantly. Watching the replay; they were not descending at a steeper than normal rate to meet the crossing at ZZZZZ at 1;800 ft. After ZZZZZ; they were descending at a normal rate to the 3.5NM 1;200 ft. crossing with rising terrain beneath them.

Halfway through the flight we received word that the ZZZ2 was shut down due to snow and snow removal. The weather had deteriorated badly. It was fine for our forecasted time of arrival and it didn't require an alternate. I didn't think to add an alternate either. After speaking with Dispatch; we decided that if the ZZZ2 airport was not open; we would divert to ZZZ. The weather was marginally okay; and it's a typical diversion airport for ZZZ2 as the passengers can drive over in an hour or so. The flight deck did get busy during the descent. We were estimating an arrival at ZZZ2 at XA:10Z; and the airport was supposed to reopen at XA:00; and I honestly expected it to reopen. We received a message from Center that the closure time had been extended to XA:30Z. At this point we elected to proceed to ZZZ. I had already checked the weather; the approaches; the NOTAMs and didn't see anything I didn't like. I also had the Captain phone the FBO in ZZZ to ask about ground conditions since there wasn't an ATC Tower on the field. The report was braking was medium and there was light snow. I elected to fly the RNAV (RNP AR) Y Approach. I landed uneventfully and it was a smooth touchdown and rollout. I maximized my use of the thrust reversers and didn't really utilize the brakes until I was below 60 kts. I'd say. I chose to continue smoothly decelerating and I planned to exit the runway at the end; at Taxiway XX. I handed the controls off to the Captain at a safe taxi speed and he exited the runway by very slowly making a left turn on XX; and then another slow left turn on XY. As I was in the middle of my after landing flows; I began to feel the airplane slide. I looked up and he was trying to turn left but the airplane was heading straight ahead towards the edge of the taxiway. Beyond the taxiway was a small curb; a fence and a small hill. I knew he was using the brakes fully; and he maximized his use of reverse thrust. I was convinced we were going to run off the taxiway; and by the time we had stopped I wasn't sure if we had or not. I was sort of in a state of shock at the time; and I think he barely just let off the brakes as the nose wheel steering tiller was all the way to the left; and the airplane began slowly turning on the taxiway. We centered the aircraft on XY very slowly. Airport Operations was on frequency and I told them to come down and check our skid marks in the snow to see if we had gone off the taxiway. They arrived and said we'd missed it by a half an inch. As we continued to taxi to the FBO; airport operations told us that XX was NOTAMed closed. I didn't recall seeing any NOTAM; and I told him that. He said he'd look into it. We parked and shut down without any further incident. Upon review of my outbound paperwork; indeed the XX closure was on my flight release paperwork. But I didn't have any paperwork for ZZZ for the flight in question. I was connected to my aircraft WIFI and I was using the Jeppesen App to look at the weather; which was updating fine. The NOTAMs never showed up; and thus I assumed there weren't any. Also complicating this was my fatigue level. It was a very early morning. I have had several minimum rest overnights in the last week and they really add up. I had already called in fatigued earlier in the week for a similar situation. But I felt rested enough to do this trip; and admittedly I felt a little pressure because I didn't want to call fatigue twice in one week. But the short overnights; early mornings and hectic days really take a toll on the crew members; including myself. I just wanted to get that plane from A to B to C so that I could get off it and get home the next day. The operations and scheduling were very taxing on me this week. I should clarify; that I was not in a state of fatigue this morning; but I was certainly not my best. I don't think either of us were. I encourage our weeks duty and rest to be reviewed. I have attached screenshots of my Jeppesen App where I was reviewing the weather and the NOTAMs for this flight. My suggestion is to alter our scheduling so that we do not have chronic minimum rest (or close to it) overnights with very early shows. I can adapt to time changes and body clock shifts; but these 10-11 hour rest periods with very early show times do not allow me the time to do this. The other suggestion I have is for the FAA and the NOTAM system. They are notoriously complicated; and very difficult to understand. More than half of them are absolutely useless and it's just more garbage to try to sort through. I need important NOTAMs to be published and displayed.",,,,"Pilot reported loss of aircraft control during taxi following landing rollout that resulted in a taxiway excursion.",

As I was Pilot Monitoring; I asked FO (First Officer) to take the radios and continue our departure while I worked the QRC for immediate action or ECAM exceptions. We leveled at 8;000 ft. and discussed the ECAM and I proceeded to accomplish ECAM actions. We then asked ATC for vectors to work on a Maintenance issue.

During the turn the tug began to slip and slide on the snow and ice. The tug did not appear to have any chains on the tires and the taxiways were covered in snow; and I presume; ice under the snow. The tug moved to a position to the left side of the flight deck at such an angle it was no longer able to push the aircraft back and became stuck on the ice. The Tug Driver asked me to set the brakes and I complied. The Tug Driver said they were going to remove the tow bar; move the tug; and re-attach from a new position to try the push from a different angle. However; the tow bar was now bound up and could not be removed from either the tug; nor the nose gear. Next; the Tug Driver said he was going to move the tug slightly to take the pressure off the tow bar and asked me to release the brakes. I complied and after informing the Tug Driver that the brakes were released; the tug began to try to move sideways away from the aircraft. During this tug movement; it felt like the tow bar became disconnected and fell off the nose gear. When the tow bar dropped off the nose gear; the aircraft began to move forward. The Tug Driver then urgently called; 'Captain!; Captain!'. I applied toe brakes immediately as I knew what had happened; and even though the wrong verbiage was used; I understood the urgency. After just a moment the Tug Driver stated; 'Set Brakes!'; but by that point I had the aircraft stopped. I set the brakes as requested. It is my impression that we may have moved about a ft. or less forward. A minute or so later the Tug Driver informed us that the aircraft had moved over the tow bar and the bar had become lodged between the two nose gear tires. I can only visualize what he meant; but I can say that they indicated they were now completely unable to remove the tow bar from under the nose gear. When it was determined that the tow bar was stuck and we were not going anywhere I stated that I was going to shut down both engines. A number of Ground Personnel had now shown up at the nose gear and I was concerned about personnel safety with the engines running. Numerous Maintenance and Ground Supervisors showed up in vehicles to survey the situation. Subsequently; quite a bit of banging could be heard; and felt from below; as they attempted to remove the tow bar from under the nose gear. A considerable time elapsed until I was told that Maintenance would need to cut the the tow bar loose. I have no idea how that was accomplished but eventually the tow bar was removed. Maintenance then asked if I could taxi into Gate XY; but I said no; as I wanted a nose gear inspection before attempting to move or to steer under my own power. I asked to be towed back into the gate. They agreed without question and a new tug was brought over; which had chains on the tires; and a new tow bar was connected. We were tugged back to Gate XY for inspection. After a couple of hours Maintenance had eventually replaced the tow-bar attachment coupler on the nose gear and cleared the aircraft to fly.

We were located very close to a busy Class B airport and were accustomed to hearing departing air traffic. Departing traffic was headed either southbound or westbound for much of the day; but recently shifted to northbound departures. This runway change moved departure traffic's crosswind turn to within a mile of our site.Departing airline traffic was no factor - their predictable routing and higher climb gradient meant they were well outside of possible collision hazards. Piston airplanes; however; required situational awareness and foresight to retain appropriate separation. I was not flying my aircraft at this time; but I looked around quickly upon hearing a piston-powered airplane. The early afternoon sun made it hard to see oncoming traffic from the east. I gained visual sight of a Cessna departing on an early crosswind turnout to the west from Runway XX. The other operator was not from my organization; nor were we operating together. But due to the urgency; I alerted the RPIC who immediately began a descent. The Cessna passed directly over and; likely; within 100 ft. of altitude from the other operator's UAS. Local environment was one causal factor: high buildings and obstructions blocked much of the VO's view. Poor situational awareness on behalf of both the other operator and his VO led to late detection of manned air traffic. The VO was likely in a poor position to execute his task of scanning for traffic. No radios or internet-supplied traffic data appeared to be in use by the operator. This operator had no knowledge of visual separation minimums. When asked about mitigating altitude conflict with the local traffic; the RPIC referenced his airspace authorization. He overlooked the fact that a UAS airspace authorization does not free the RPIC from see-and-avoid responsibilities. To his credit though; he did make a timely evasive action once the imminent threat was detected. This operator and his operation lacked the professionalism and situational awareness necessary to fly in a complex airspace near Class B airport operations. More awareness for UAS operators on manned flight procedures would have aided this party in reducing the risk posed to manned aviation. Jet traffic likely led to complacency for this operator; who then had no knowledge of instrument Departure Procedures or airplane performance to aid in his risk management.","The reporter reiterated this report was for something they witnessed by another operator.",,,"Part 107 pilot reported observing another UAS operator flying a nearby UAS have a near miss with a general aviation aircraft on climb out.",

We stop the aircraft and clarify with ATC. I reported that we had unfortunately missed our turn onto Yankee. But ATC responded that we were exactly where we were supposed to be. ATC clarified that Yankee is only the short piece that connects 2 North with Hotel 6. We continued to taxi across Hotel and held short of 34R at H6. I was looking at the EFB fully zoomed in when the event occurred. Fully zoomed in ONLY the southern H6 shows up. This is why I thought we would have to use Yankee to get to H6.

The Type IV fluid applied was Dow Chemical UCAR FlightGuard AD-49 at 100% concentration. The start time of the Type IV fluid application was XA05L. According to our holdover time table; in the present conditions; the holdover time is between 46 minutes and 1 hour; 5 minutes. Taxi to Runway 10 began at approximately XA15L. The airport operations crew was working through a continuous freezing rain event; applying deicing fluids onto airport surfaces. Runway 10 was unusable for approximately 20-25 minutes; beginning when we approached the hold short line ready for departure. Several Airport Operations vehicles requested and received clearance to conduct a deicing fluid application and runway assessment. At the conclusion of their assessment; 3 arrivals were on final; further delaying our departure. When the last arrival was on short final; the First Officer and I conducted a pre-takeoff check by looking at our wings to determine the condition of the anti-ice fluid. While my winglet area looked good; the surface I could see from the base of the winglet to approximately the midpoint of the wing was now clear; with no evidence of Type IV green dye anywhere. I sent the First Officer into the cabin to get a better assessment. He easily concluded that our Type IV fluid had failed and showed me a few pictures he had taken. I agreed; and we went back to the gate. This determination was made approximately 30-35 minutes following the Type IV application start time. After some coordination with our flight attendants and ATC; we began our taxi back to the gate at around XA45L and blocked back into the gate shortly thereafter. We refueled and deiced a second time.The cause of this event was a Type IV fluid failure due to freezing rain.The holdover time for Dow Chemical UCAR FlightGuard AD-49 may need to be lowered in consideration of actual conditions experienced during a light freezing rain event with an ambient temperature of -3 Celsius. We noted that the holdover time for the same at -2 Celsius was considerably lower; with a holdover time range of 15-19 minutes. This is a drastic difference over the 46-65 minutes of holdover permitted for the same at -3 Celsius.","Reporter stated he has observed de-ice fluid performance issues on several other flights as well.

Upon considering the situation and conditions; we decided that the safest option was to return to ZZZ. Center; Approach and ZZZ Tower were all very helpful and unfailingly professional. We were able to descend without incurring excess speed by reducing rpm; and once leveled off at 2100; we were able to extend 10 degrees of flap (below 140 kias) which also helped maintain a reasonable approach speed of about 130 kias. We requested priority handling since it was then obvious that we would have to shut down the engine to land and would therefore not be able to taxi clear of the runway. We cut the mixture on short final; which allowed to aircraft to be further slowed and allowed us to fully extend the flaps. The landing was uneventful; except for having to wait to be towed from the runway.

During cruise with entry of landing data; crew discusses the landing. PIC suggested using Speed Brakes and braking to achieve the predicted landing performance of 3000 ft; in preparation for operational short field landings. A target stop point of taxiway x was suggested. It was emphasized by the PIC that this would not be a maximum effort landing. The intention was to achieve a 3000 ft landing; no more and no less. The approach was loaded and briefed. Descent and approach procedures were completed with RNAV XX vectors loaded as backup to the anticipated visual approach. ATC provided good vectors and altitude step down. With field reported in sight and cleared for a visual the SIC descended toward 1000 ft with approach armed. On base leg at about 4 miles; SIC slowed to less than 200 KIAS and began configuring. Landing checks were completed; and aircraft was on Vref (on top of donut) at approximately 800 ft. Airspeed; glide path and center line control were all good. Clear of obstacles; SIC announced and went below glide slope referencing PAPI and runway. SIC maintained speed and runway center line well. SIC maintained a slight crab to the right; countering the right crosswind. SIC went to IDLE at approximately 50 ft. (no system callout by this model of aircraft). As the SIC entered a flare; they de-crabbed the aircraft as expected. Touchdown was smooth; with good deceleration; just slightly right of center line (left main mount just left of center line) approximately 1000 ft. from the threshold. PIC announced and deployed the speed brake for the SIC. The aircraft initially tracked straight; just right of center line. SIC applied braking after approximately 3 seconds. The aircraft developed a strong drift to the right. PIC waited for correction; and then announced and took controls as the aircraft approached the side of the runway. SIC released and announced 'you have controls'. PIC applied initial and increasing control and brake input to arrest the drift. However; the aircraft response to PIC input was delayed; leading to more control and brake input. A swerve then developed to the left. PIC released some brake and attempted control with rudder/nose wheel steering. Pilot Induced Oscillation (PIO) developed with trajectory toward the left side of the runway. The PIC then applied maximum braking. The aircraft began to skid to the right. The aircraft came to a stop on the edge of the runway; past the intersection of y and the runway. PIC set the parking brake; and responded to a Tower query about condition of the aircraft and crew. PIC advised Tower of intentions; shut down both engines and performed an immediate inspection of the aircraft. The left main was blown; but still on the rim. The right main and nose were still inflated with no visible flat spots. PIC did an aircraft walk around looking for more damage; and found none. PIC called the Chief Pilot and gave a brief synopsis of what had happened and the condition of the aircraft. With company concurrence and PIC observation; the aircraft was towed by Company B past the hold short line on Taxiway Y. The Safety Officer and a maintainer arrived and inspected the aircraft. Both Main Mounts were changed. The PIC and SIC taxied the aircraft to the FBO for further inspection. The crew was assessed by the Safety Officer and the Director of Training and released by the company for further flight. The aircraft was released safe for flight by company maintenance. The original crew flew the airplane back to ZZZ2 without further incident. All systems including brakes were found to be nominal on taxi; takeoff and landing. Landing rollout was nominal. Potential causal factors to this incident; as seen by the PIC: PIC recommended achieving landing performance predicted by the system and by pre-flight performance calculations. Those numbers are more for a short field landing; and may have prompted the SIC to use excessive brake and apply brake sooner than was necessary. The PIC and SIC had a good repour. The PIC had witnessed several very good landings from the SIC; and caught somewhat off guard by the deviation from centerline. The PIC waited too long to take control of the situation; leading to the need for more aggressive inputs.The Honda Jet is known to be susceptible to Pilot Induced Oscillations (PIO) during landing rollout. This was known to the PIC but the extent of which was not realized. PIC should have approached this landing by the SIC more conservatively due to the low hours that both pilots had in model. Were there other factors in this incident? Nothing significant. The crew was well rested and healthy. All events were well planned and briefed. PIC and SIC were strong on knowledge/procedures. The crew had good communication / CRM throughout their rotation together. Weather and runway condition was a minor factor; in that right crosswind may have contributed to the initial deviation from centerline. PIC takeaway: Approach the landing of the Honda Jet more conservatively. A 5000 ft. runway should be the shortest attempted without much more experience; or improvements made to the aircraft's systems reducing the PIO tendency. Brake application during landing rollout must be very careful in terms of how quickly and how much is applied. Directional control must be paramount over landing distance; and brakes released and centerline regained in the event of directional trouble. The PIC will certainly take this incident in account on future landings; and approach them with more caution.",,,,"Honda Jet PIC reported a loss of directional control during landing rollout when attempting to correct a center line drift after taking controls from the SIC. Ultimately the aircraft stopped on runway with only a left blown tire.",

After a short delay power was added to accelerate the aircraft to a speed adequate for some rudder effectiveness. Unfortunately; FO applied abrupt; hard rudder movement causing the aircraft to swerve abruptly. My feet were following on the rudder pedals. Attempted to regain control calling out I've got it two times. Unfortunately; I believe FO and I were attempting to control the aircraft at the same time. Power was pulled (reduced) to idle and into reverse. After several abrupt heading changes we left the runways left side and entered onto the grass covered soil.

Aircraft towed to [FBO] ramp and secured.Unfortunately few pilots are trained in Tail Wheel aircraft today. A tail wheel airplane teaches pilot how to better handle any x-wind component while taxiing or taking off and landing. A nose gear airplane is like a child's bike with training wheels attached. The same applies to an airplane. It's been my experience since flying with many different nationalities that a pilot who has only flown a nose gear plane is lacking in basic x-wind flying skills. Attempting to teach a low time pilot with no airplane tail wheel training before attempting to fly a Douglas DC3 is an accident waiting to happen. Unfortunately my employer is not able to find any perspective tail wheel pilots to hire. That puts the instructor in a difficult position because he must allow the student to pilot the airplane.",,,,"DC-3 instructor reported a loss of directional control by a trainee during takeoff roll resulting in a runway excursion.

I was no longer talking to Aircraft Y but Aircraft X was on my frequency so I cancelled their approach clearance and turned them to a 220 heading however I didn't give them an altitude to maintain and they were below the minimum vectoring altitude. I was not aware that Aircraft Y was VFR on their climb out so there was no loss of separation. Better communication between the radar and local Controller. Another Controller called down to the TRACON and was coordinating and relaying information instead of me directly. I was hesitant to assign an altitude when I wasn't sure what Aircraft Y was doing but I should have assigned the MVA as soon as I vectored them off the approach and canceled their approach clearance.

Aircraft Y; on departure; turned southeast towards the Aircraft X. They were maintaining VFR and the closest they got was 500 ft. and 3.1 miles. The Local Controller issued a turn to the Aircraft X at 1600 ft. busting MVA. Missing the read back was primary cause of the event. I also issued the runway heading speaking faster than I normally would; which was mainly due to being busier than I have been in last couple of months. I will also say that a lot of Controllers would have issued 'turn left to ZZZ1; maintain VFR' for the climb out. If that was issued the Aircraft Z would have did the same thing. I wanted to keep it simple since I was busy.

The incident occurred upon touchdown Runway XL at ZZZ. Captain was in control of the aircraft and this approach to Runway XL was stabilized. The aircraft was crabbed left considerably into the wind and holding runway center line. It was my expectation that the Pilot Flying would apply right rudder and left aileron control moments before touchdown in order to align the aircraft with the runway center line. However; we landed with a side load and this is when loss of directional control began. Because we landed crabbed left we began traveling further left of center line. I called for right rudder and aileron into the wind. At this point we rapidly departed the left side of Runway XL into the safety area where pilot flying applied full power and began the go around from the safety area. In the go-around we remained in a VFR traffic pattern with gear down (gear was never cycled) and flaps 15 degrees. At this point my concentration was orientating and navigating us to the more favorable Runway YY.The Captain remained Pilot Flying throughout the event. We safely navigated to and landed on Runway YY. Before departing ZZZ1 the Captain expressed their intentions to use XL at ZZZ. I informed them the winds favor YY. The Captain seemed to agree; however; later after listening to the ATIS at ZZZ they decided XL. Again I asked them to take a look at the crosswinds and Runway YY as an option. The Captain kept their decision for XL. The winds were strong 270 at 19 gusts 28 in ATIS but not exceeding the max crosswind for the Aircraft X. I had never flown with the Captain but I knew they had been with the company since 2015 and seemed confident in their ability to safely land in the crosswind so I said no more regarding this runway choice. It is my suggestion we review crosswind landing techniques and how crew resource management could have helped us in this situation.",,"Landing on Runway XL with gusty winds from 290/14G25 at some point during flare the airplane takes to the left abruptly I applied full right rudder in order to keep the airplane center line but then another push to the left occurs at that moment I decided to go-around; when I started the go-around the airplane keeps the tendency to the left; making the main gear touch the grass; for that reason I did not put the gear up and keep it down; I did the right downwind for Runway YY and landed. On the post flight I checked with the Mechanic if any damage occurred but everything looks normal; except for a small amount of grass in the left tire.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a loss of control and runway excursion during landing.

We monitored and the pressurization began to stabilize however in the descent the cabin pressure remained higher than what it does regularly all the way to the ground. Other than that we had no issues on the first leg. When on the ground in ZZZ; Person A talked to Maintenance and explained what had happened and Maintenance said that if the pressurization system corrected itself then we are okay to continue. We also saw that there was a write up earlier in the day from the crew that had the plane before us; they were having pressurization EICAS messages occur when starting Engine 1. Maintenance had taken a look and the pressurization system operated normally when they checked it. Before taking off from ZZZ; Person A and I briefed that we were going to request a lower altitude in case we had another pressurization anomaly. After taking off in ZZZ we got an annunciation that the baggage door had opened and our auto pressurization was not working correctly as well; we did not lose any pressure so we continued and followed the QRH procedure. In manual mode we were able to get the pressurization exactly where it needed to be for the altitude we were at based on the graph in the QRH so we continued the flight per the QRH procedure. We also requested a lower altitude in case we ran into any other pressurization anomalies ATC was able to accommodate and Person A made sure to be very clear that we were not requesting priority handling. As we were flying to ZZZ1 we continued to monitor the cabin pressure and QRH graph and made very small adjustments to keep it exactly where it was supposed to be. When they had about 20 minutes left of flying and were getting to the arrival portion of the flight I began to feel a little bit euphoric as well as a little bit of tingling in my fingers. I immediately told Person A what I was feeling they said they felt off as well and said to put on our masks immediately. We both are aware of the signs of hypoxia and how it can creep up on people without them even realizing it. Once our masks were on we continued to monitor cabin pressure and nothing had changed which was contradictory to what we experienced. We did not want to take any chances with hypoxia so we requested a lower altitude and let ATC know it was because we were having pressurization issues but made sure to confirm we were not requesting priority handling. At this point we were on the arrival and ATC was giving us lower while on the arrival we were task saturated making sure we had complied all necessary checklist and we got up to 265 kts. at 8000 ft. Person A immediately corrected and the rest of the arrival and approach went smoothly. Something is not operating correctly with the pressurization system of the aircraft.

This incident occurred on a clear day around XA24UTC on Day 0 while practicing touch and goes in the pattern in a C172P. After my second touch and go I was on the runway applying full power for another take-off. While building speed to takeoff before I started rotating I heard the Controller clear an airplane that was holding short to take-off on the same runway I was on. I'd never seen a Controller do this and it seemed unusual at the time but I continued my takeoff. My climbout was normal and I turned crosswind at about 600 AGL. Right before beginning the turn to downwind I heard my traffic alert go off telling me I had close traffic at 8 o'clock. I began my turn to downwind while looking for the traffic expecting it to be in the upwind. Instead the other pilot had made their crosswind turn closer to the runway and had cut me off while climbing. Luckily they were in a SR22 and at a higher altitude than mine but they were right in front of me taking up almost my entire windshield. While they may have been slightly too high for us to collide I feared for my safety considering how close they were and pulled power to idle immediately and initiated a descent. After they were clear of me and continued their crosswind departure I regained my altitude and continued in the pattern as usual. Since I've never had an incident like this and was surprised I did not think to notify the Tower while in the air. Once on the ground; I wanted to discuss it with an experienced pilot; my instructor and the head of flight school. We went over the voice recording and I was educated about this reporting service. My instructor and I located the other pilot and had a debrief call of the incident. They acknowledged the incident as well and confirmed they started their turn at 400 AGL. They shared that they did not see me after I took off. They weren't sure if I was still on the runway when they were cleared but agreed that they could have been more vigilant and less complacent when the Tower cleared them for left turnout and knowing another plane was in the pattern. They also confirmed their traffic alert triggered as well (theirs was older and didn't call my location).We discussed the implications of the classic high-wing / low-wing combination and how it further contributed to this very dangerous situation (they were right wing up while I was on their right with left wing down). Since they were heading to ZZZ1 via the coast; the nearby naval airspace added another element of limited maneuvering space for them as well. On my end; I figured out it would've been good for me to call out that I was in the upwind and turning crosswind and downwind in the same direction they cleared to turn out. Chances are the other more experienced pilot would have reacted to my callout with more vigilance. Also; since I felt the Tower cleared them to takeoff too early I could have also considered aborting my takeoff and questioning it on the ground. Finally; we asked the flight school to share this with the Tower Supervisor so they can learn and improve as well.",,,,"C172 single pilot reported an NMAC event during landing pattern training.

The following events are what took place leading up to the event. Upon arriving at ZZZ the ceilings were broken at 1600; with light winds and good visibility. Getting to the aircraft; I first did my preflight walk around following the checklist and everything was normal with nothing alarming. Following the preflight; I turned on the batteries and checked the fuel quantities and made sure the interior preflight inspection was done thoroughly and by the checklist. Everything was normal so I called ZZZ Clearance and picked up my flight plan to ZZZ1. The flight plan was radar vectors; ZZZZZ Departure with the ZZZ2 transition; followed by the ZZZZZ1 Arrival with ZZZZZ1 as the transition into ZZZ3 Airspace. By this time; the passengers were arriving; and I helped them load their bags which consisted of just a couple hanging bags and small duffel bags. Once they were loaded in and buckled up; the start procedure was normal with no negative indications across any systems. Before taxiing; I performed the Pusher Test (Flaps 15 and torque above 5 PSI) which was completed with no failures. After this; I began taxiing out to Runway XX and called Clearance to report that I was number one; holding short of Runway XX. They gave me a right turn to heading 220 and up to 2000 ft. and released me for departure. I switched to CTAF and taxied onto Runway XX. At this point; all checklists had been completed; there were no cautions; warnings; or advisories indicated so I proceeded with a normal take-off. After leaving the ground there was light turbulence. I turned the lights off; raised the gear; turned the yaw dampener on; and moved the flap lever to the up position coming through about 300 ft. AGL. Shortly after; I received an Amber 'Flaps' Message followed by an Amber 'Pusher' Message; a Blue 'Pusher Safe Mode' Message; and an Amber Flap Position Indicator that was not moving and was stuck at roughly the 14-degree position. The aircraft was still controllable; and I proceeded to my climb to my assigned altitude and turn right to my assigned heading of 220. At roughly 1000 ft. I switched from the CTAF to ZZZ Departure and they told me to continue my climb to 4000 ft. and remain on a heading of 220. I complied and at this point I was using the QRH to try to diagnose the problem. Once I read the QRH; step 2 was to land as soon as practical. Reading this; I [requested priority handling] with ZZZ Departure because I did not want the problem to get worse. I felt that for the safety of my passengers; other aircraft; and myself; it was best to get priority to get on the ground as quickly as possible in such a busy airspace. After coordinating this with Departure; I was above the broken cloud layer and needed to load the RNAV approach back into Runway XX at ZZZ. The Controller then gave me vectors to the approach and a successful approach was carried out with a landing speed approximately 10 kts. higher than the AOA Dynamic Speed Bug. I then taxied to the ramp; shut down the engine and deboarded my passengers.",,,,"PC12 Pilot reported shortly after take-off; receiving an Amber 'Flaps' Message followed by an Amber 'Pusher' Message; a Blue 'Pusher Safe Mode' Message; and an Amber Flap Position Indicator that was not moving and was stuck at roughly the 14-degree position.

When I asked what the on course heading was; the pilot responded that they were on course. I told the pilot negative; they were not cleared on course and to fly heading 080. I asked again what the on course heading was. At this time the pilot became confused and appeared to have stopped their turn; leveled at 4;500 and was now heading south towards the MVA.Moments later; Local Control called to inform me to watch for the MVA and I responded that I was. I told the pilot multiple times to expedite their turn and climb. The plane then entered the edge of the MVA at 5;300 for a moment before turning back north. On the part of the Controller; I feel that I could have told the pilot to turn left heading 080 upon reaching 6;000 but this is assuming that I felt that the plane couldn't make the turn.

The ZZZ1 area was covered with moderate turbulence and thunderstorms were moving through the sector. Prior to the approach I briefed the PM on a possible wind-shear escape maneuver should the possibility arise. The ATIS was not reporting wind-shear and it seemed the other traffic ahead of us were getting into ZZZ just fine. We had just flown in on the ZZZZZ1 arrival with very strong moderate turbulence all the way in. As we were cleared for the approach I selected flaps and gear down on normal schedule and complied with the speed restrictions given to us by ATC. As we turned final I could see an ominous looking cloud that appeared to be moving across the path to the runway at the FAF ZZZZZ. In a break in the cloud I could visually see the runway lights off and on. I prepared for the possibility that the cloud would emanate some turbulence. As we passed through it on the backside of it I felt the airplane get rolled to the right and I felt the plane being pushed down.We did not receive any wind-shear warnings or cautions aurally. I counteracted as it was being forced down and then I felt the airspeed dropping rapidly. I felt as if a downdraft was causing us to be pushed down at an uncontrollable rate. At that point I knew we needed to apply power and climbout of it. I initiated a go-around thinking it was wind-shear pushing us down. I also heard a 'caution obstacle' message. Initially; as I added power it seemed like we were not able to climb immediately. The go around was not perfect but we quickly became busy as I felt we had a terrain issue along with the wind shear. Then we cleared the wind shear and we started climbing rapidly and our speed quickly became very high and we were very close to our go around altitude of 2000 already. The PM informed the Tower that we were going around for wind shear in which they provided a heading and altitude of 2000. I knew we were about to blow through that altitude so I had him ask for a higher altitude. We over flew the altitude by around 300 ft. The Tower did not want to give us higher as they 'did not control that airspace'. Eventually we went over to Approach and they provided us 4000 ft. I received a high speed message during the event; as the flaps were still extended and in transition and sometime during all this I asked for the gear to be retracted and then flaps 2 which was out of order.I also called for FL 210 but the cockpit became very busy quickly and we did not get it set right away as the aural high speed message was going off along with trying to listen to ATC. I became concerned with the high speed and trying to comply with the ATC altitude. We eventually cleaned up the plane and reengaged automation. The event certainly shook both of us up; however after we had the aircraft under normal flying conditions we briefed the passengers of what happened; loaded another approach; and returned for a second and successful landing. I should have done better with my call outs and procedures. I should have at least called TOGA; and once clear of the shear: flaps 2; (positive rate) gear up; and FLCH 210. Adding the amount of power I did felt right as we seemed to be rolling and descending in the wrong direction and I felt we needed to climb immediately. However; I was also distracted trying to keep us from climbing too far above our target altitude and got behind on the recovery.",,"I do want to preface this account by saying my memory of the events is not very clear; and after the moment we began the go-around; the exact timing and what happened became a blur of events. I was PM on Aircraft X from ZZZ2 to ZZZ. We had started our day at XA:30pm and dealt with delays getting in to ZZZ2 due to thunderstorms. Both our flights from ZZZ to ZZZ2 and from ZZZ2 to ZZZ were filled with multiple areas of convective activity and associated turbulence. As we approached ZZZ; the field had some thunderstorms in the area but the latest ATIS was showing a good prognosis with winds dying down to something like 160 at 7 kts or so. Approach had vectored us around at 4;000 or so and the entire time at that altitude we were dealing with moderate turbulence. The Captain (CA) had to override the auto throttles during this time to keep the speed under control. I do recall the CA briefed the wind shear escape maneuver before we set up for the approach as well.Eventually we got vectored southwest and then set up on final for the ILS X. We were told to slow to 160 kts till ZZZZZ and cleared for the approach. Shortly before the FAF; the CA had given me the proper commands to fully configure the plane and we were stabilized at about 1;700 feet. I'm not really sure when the CA switched to green needles; or when the Autopilot (AP) was kicked off as the approach does require it (I believe it was right before we passed the FAF). As we neared ZZZZZ; we could see the runway and lights below several scattered cloud layers. There was an almost a U shaped thin cloud in front of us that rose a couple hundred feet on both sides of the aircraft. We passed right through the middle of this cloud and it was about this time that the approach completely fell apart. I recall seeing the speed start to bleed off pretty quickly; almost 10 kts past our speed. The CA responded by moving the throttles forward quite aggressively and the speed started to come back. However it felt like we were dropping aggressively and the plane had started a slight roll (10 degrees or so) to the right.I don't recall if this happened before or after the CA told me were going around; but we got an obstacle alert. The CA told me we were going around but didn't state the correct phrase (Go-Around; TOGA; Flaps 2). He did hit the TOGA button though and we began to get speed and altitude back. I remember trying to look at the EICAS and verify TOGA set but the screen was really dark and I couldn't verify it immediately. I do recall seeing something resembling 'obstacle proximity' on my Primary Flight Display (PFD) in red; and I think we got 1 aural 'OBSTACLE' alert; but the whole moment happened very quickly. I do remember that I eventually stated TOGA set after I was able to verify despite it being so dark. The last thing I remember about looking at the glide slope was that we were about a 1/2 to 3/4 dot low during the time the speed bled off abruptly. I was completely unsure as to what we were dealing with since we didn't get a single wind shear alert; and Tower had not told us about any wind shear reports. The glide slope alert never went off either. Either way the go around was done incorrectly.As the CA hit TOGA and I tried to verify TOGA set; we neglected to move flaps to position 2 right away. I recall telling Tower we were going around and they told us to climb to 2;000 feet and fly heading 040. I think I missed a call; but with the alerts going off; it was extremely hard to focus on one thing at a time. The Captain asked for FLCH 210 and it was really hard to verify the correct button in the dark cockpit but I think I hit it and had 210 dialed in. At this point; the airplane was rocketing upwards and the speed was the only thing I remember going up a lot. The Captain told me gear up and I didn't even think to verify the flaps were at 2 before doing that. As a result we had the landing gear aural alert going off. Then CA told me to bring flaps to 2 and I did. Around thistime the airspeed had climbed significantly and the last number I remember was 240 and we started getting high speed (not sure if this was before or after flaps moved to 2). After I had verified the instructions from ATC; the CA told me we needed higher and I told ATC that. They told me they can't do that as they don't control that airspace.The CA also told me we needed to turn to the left to get out of whatever we were dealing with. I don't think I was able to pass that on as Tower was giving us a new frequency and asking if it was wind shear. We did blow through 2;000 and leveled at 2;200 I believe and then got cleared up to 3;000. Before switching I heard the Tower Controller tell the plane behind us that they were getting wind shear alerts for Runway X gain of 20 kts and another plane called up and said they gained 20 (not sure if it was arrival or departure). Eventually the CA called flaps up; and then said incrementally but I had mistakenly moved them up all the way. I then moved them back to position 1 and then up. Either way it was clear we had over-sped them. We cleaned up; switched over to Approach and got vectored around. We then shot the second attempt on the same approach with no issue. Once we landed the CA called Maintenance to inform them of the over speed event and write up the plane which had finished for the night. Overall we were completely caught off guard by this event as it was not expected and the weather conditions had been improving in the area as well. Both me and the CA were pretty shaken up by the event as the obstacle alert is something that neither of us ever expected to see; even with a wind shear event.It is also important to note that I don't believe ATC ever gave us a warning or talking to for exceeding our altitude of 2;000 feet on the go-around. While it's hard to remember the correct details; I think we responded appropriately by a go-around. However we should have done a wind shear escape procedure even though it was never annunciation. Secondly; even though we elected to do a go-around; we didn't use the correct callouts and as a result of that; ATC calls during the event; the obstacle alert; and other distractions; we caused the flap over speed. The go-around was also abnormal to me since we weren't below 1;000 feet and were pretty limited with the altitude available to climb. I think better CRM would have resulted in a correct go-around procedure or wind shear escape procedure as the whole event could be characterized with 'tunnel vision' on my part as well. I also should have the corrected the Captain from the moment we elected to go-around by taking control of the situation and configuring the airplane even if the Captain was distracted and didn't verbally tell me. ATC didn't help the situation as they did not immediately clear us to 3;000 feet and I was concerned with the 200 feet above assigned altitude that we had deviated from. This distracted me as well with helping to configure the aircraft. Overall; my lack of following the SOP in regards to callouts and actions exaggerated an already difficult situation.",,"EMB-170 Flight Crew reported a wind shear event during final approach in turbulent conditions. The Flight Crew executed a successful wind shear recovery procedure which caused momentary airspeed and altitude deviations.",

For this leg I was PM and the Captain was Pilot flying (PF). Landing and taxi in was normal. We were guided by a 'Follow Me' vehicle to park; a jet bridge equipped parking spot at the terminal. As we approached the parking spot; we identified the Military Marshaller with wands standing on a set of stairs leading up to the terminal. This position put the Marshaller off to the left of the nose of the airplane; rather than in line with the parking line as is usual at most parking spots. Because of the Marshaller's position; I lost sight of them for the final 10 or so feet of the taxi in. I never saw them again after this point. The Captain stopped the aircraft; and applied the parking brake as normal. I began my shutdown flow; transferred power the APU and configured the Hydraulic Panel. The Captain shutdown the engines; and I turned off the seat belt signs. While completing the rest of my flow; the Captain received the 'Chocks In' signal from the Marshaller and released the parking brake. The Captain called for the Shutdown checklist.Shortly after starting the checklist; while still 'heads down'; I became aware of the sensation of movement and the Captain immediately applied the brakes. Captain had been 'heads up' and had noticed the movement; as well as signals from the Ground Crew; before I did and thus was able to apply corrective active quickly. I ensured that the Hyd #4 was in the AUX position; that Hydraulic pressure was adequate and turned the Seat Belt Signs back to ON. The Captain made a PA informing the passengers and crew to remain seated while we waited for a tug to pull us back into position. While waiting for the tug; the Company Mechanic plugged their headset in; and informed us that they had been behind the nose wheel installing a gear pin when the aircraft began to roll. The aircraft had rolled straight back approximately 9 meters. The Captain explained to them that the Marshaller had given the 'Chocks In' signal. The Mechanic then went to have a discussion with the Marshaller off-headset. The Mechanic returned to us; noticeably shaken and angry; and explained that the Marshaller admitted to giving us the 'Chocks In' signal; but thought that it indicated that they were in the process of placing the chocks; not that they were in place. This is an interpretation of that hand signal that I've never seen before and believe to be incorrect even on military fields. The aircraft was pulled forward; and secured with positive headset communication with our Mechanic. No injuries were reported; and an inspection by myself and maintenance staff indicated no damage as a result. The Marshaller left before either I or the Captain could speak to them; and so no debrief was possible. Incorrect usage of hand signals lead to the release of the parking brake before the wheel chocks were in place. Proper training of Marshals; to include differences between Military and Civilian hand signals (where any exist) is critical. Additionally; having a Ground Staff member plug into the interphone system as early as possible after stopping would provide a clearer means of communication than hand signals. Possibly an adjustment to ground staff procedures could be made so that the Mechanic should wait until after the chocks are in place before standing behind the nose gear to install pins. Finally; ensuring that at least one Crew Member is 'heads up' (as the Captain was in this situation) will provide an extra layer of safety; especially during the busy period immediately after parking where the FO is 'heads down' conducting shutdown flows and checklists.",,"While operating Aircraft X; ZZZZ1 to ZZZZ; we had a completely uneventful flight up until it came time to park the aircraft. I was the Pilot Flying. We were marshalled into the gate by a Military Marshaller who was standing halfway up the stairs near the jet way at an elevation a little less than the flight deck level. He was at a 10 o'clock position and we were both visible to each other but not necessarily fully visible to the First Officer (FO). Everything went smoothly. We taxied forward slowly. The Marshaller slowly crossed their wands and the aircraft was brought to a stop. The parking brake was set. The Marshaller then turned away and proceeded down the stairs to ground level. The First Officer switched the power over to the APU and the engines were shut down. The hydraulics were switched per normal procedures. #4 to AUX and 1;2;3 to OFF. Proper flows were completed.I looked back outside. The local Company Mechanic was approaching the aircraft. They did not have a headset with them. I looked at the Marshaller; who was now on the ground at a 10 o'clock position. They put his two wands together 'tip to tip' in front of them; universal for indicating the 'chocks were in place'. I gave them a thumbs up and they signaled back with a thumbs up. The brakes were then released with no aircraft movement. The seat belt sign was then selected off. I called for the shutdown checklist and the FO and I commenced it. I glanced up and noticed movement. The aircraft was slowly rolling backwards away from the gate. The Marshaller was frantically crossing their arms. I immediately pressed the toe brakes quickly stopping the aircraft and reset the parking brake. Later; according to the Mechanic; the aircraft rolled about 3 meters. The chocks were not in place; contrary to the Marshaller's hand signals.I made a PA for everyone to remain seated as we now had to be towed back in. The Mechanic was then observed going back to his truck to get their headset and returned to the aircraft and plugged in. They stated that they were almost run over while placing the bypass pin in and that they also observed the same incorrect signals from the Marshaller and was able to get out of the way in time. They then had an angry confrontation with the Marshaller over it. They reported to me that the Marshaller argued with him that 'they park aircraft all the time this way and that the placing of the wands 'tip to tip' in front was 'asking me if I WANTED chocks''. This is not a way to deliver a question. And when do we ever NOT chock an aircraft? Never; in three decades of professional flying; have I ever seen the universal signal of wands tip to tip indicate anything other than 'chocks in place'. They should have remained visible on the stairs with their wands crossed; hold position; until the chocks were confirmed in place. The aircraft was then towed back into position and properly chocked. No injuries were reported and the passengers disembarked. The Mechanic came to the flight deck and was visibly angry. They were furious at the Marshaller. The Marshaller drove away and could not be found; as I wished to speak with them as well.",,"B747-400 flight crew reported after arriving at the gate; the Marshaller gave the chocks in hand signal to them. The Captain released the parking brake and noticed the aircraft was rolling back. After the parking brake was reset; a tug was called to reposition the aircraft. Wheel chocks had never been put in place.",

Aircraft X arrived approximately XB45 and was scheduled to depart to ZZZ at XC45. Aircraft X arrived with 2 inbound write ups. Logbook Referral Sheet # XXXXXXX for intermittent Right Engine Anti Ice Light during climbout; and Logbook Referral Sheet # XXXXXXY for MAINT Light related to Engine Anti Ice issue. Maintenance Control was called for deferral of Engine Cowl Anti Ice. MEL 30-XX-X was applied in conjunction with MEL 36-XX-Y (MEL 30-XX-X states to apply MEL 36-XX-Y). Maintenance Control was in concurrence and agreement with me; and Dispatch was also in agreement for application of MEL 30-XX-X. We then proceeded to start MELs by locking out valves and performing Aircraft Maintenance Manual (AMM) procedures and ran into an issue with MEL 30-XX-X; with the disconnection of all 3 pressure switches. Only 2 existed. Engineering Department reviewed our MELs being applied to Aircraft X; and presumably agreed concurrence with MEL and issue found; then proceeded to create Engineering Authorization for acknowledgement of our issue of 2 pressure switches vs what MEL states for 3 pressure switches. All final checks were accomplished; logbook was signed and approved for deferral; then Aircraft X left the gate after a 2 hour and 30-minute delay heading to ZZZ1. The next day; I was notified by Maintenance Control Technician Person A who worked with me the night before; stating that we applied the wrong MEL to Aircraft X; and the Aircraft should have been grounded due to the issue it had.The event occurred due to inadequate training and knowledge of the new 737 MAX changes to its systems. I; the Maintenance Control Department including Crew that night; Dispatch Department; and possibly the Engineering Department had no idea that the wrong MEL was applied; while ALL of us were in agreement about correct MEL placement to Aircraft X. The MAX has 2 new lights above the ENG ANTI-ICE selector switches that are named ENGINE ANTI-ICE. I have personally performed Anti-Ice MELs before; but I did not know that those 2 new lights were added as a change to the MAX. The right-hand ENGINE ANTI-ICE light was the discrepant issue; not the COWL ANTI-ICE which was the deferral used. Reasons that the event occurred are due to the fact of inadequate knowledge of the 737 MAX. All Technicians qualified in ZZZ received a very brief; X-hour classroom training. The training we received in its entirety was not sufficient enough to possibly save an issue from happening like this again. The issue was found by 1 Technician working that night later in the evening and was the only Technician familiar with this issue due to a problem he has dealing with an ENGINE ANTI-ICE light before. Pressure was applied to me with another broken Aircraft; Aircraft X on a turn; a Period service check I still had to perform that left at XI00; after finishing turns at XE00 and also constant phone calls about the status of the aircraft; pressure from Management to hurry; and Crew time-out being almost used to cancel flight.TRAINING. Training on the MAX is crunched down into a X-hour classroom; which is not efficient enough to learn an entire new airframe and new power plant. All qualified technicians on the MAX now bear the responsibility to know all systems; though our other aircraft training was a Y-week course. This shortening of course time will only lead to lack of knowledge and complacency. This tactic is very dangerous. Insufficient training to either Flight or Maintenance personnel is a human factor we can all avoid if we were taught with more specifics on aircraft. I cannot recall learning about this specific change to the ANTI-ICE system on a 737 MAX in our X-hour course. It makes you wonder what else the company missed to put in their official MAX Maintenance training program. The company needs to withhold the responsibility for inadequate training and must not hold the people performing the work be held accountable for actions they simply just don't know.",,"Received a call from ZZZ about Aircraft X. The aircraft had a write up for INTERMITTENT RIGHT ENGINE ANTI-ICE LIGHT DURING CLIMB OUT. This is a common issue on the 737 NG and points to Cowl Anti Ice. When discussing MEL with Maintenance; our thoughts went straight to a Cowl Anti Ice problem. After issues with applying MEL 30-XX-X needed Engineering Authorization and 35-XX-Y; we deferred the items and closed the aircraft out. I was approached shortly after by a coworker that alerted me that we may not have applied the MEL properly. We mistakenly missed that the MAX has an extra valve for Engine Anti Ice (Core Booster). I contacted the Dispatcher; and he advised me that the aircraft had just taken off a minute before. He said he would contact his Chief Dispatcher to discuss options.Complacency with a similar issue. Training and awareness.The software program is where we confirmed there was an issue. I will try to be more aware when evaluating issues with the MAX. Training and awareness. Talking to a few fellow technicians  and mechanics; training was anywhere from a few hours to X days for the Differences class.",,"Technicians and Maintenance Controller reported applying an incorrect MEL to a B737 MAX with an Engine Anti Ice problem.

After we returned from an uneventful flight while securing the cover I noticed an FAA 'Aircraft Condition Notice' tag attached to the bottom of the cover. The tag cited 3 mechanical items and stated the aircraft was un-airworthy. The items cited were brake fluid leaking; cowling fastener missing; and nose gear attach rod loose. During our preflight we did see brake fluid on the ground under the main wheels but no signs of leaking or dripping. We did a thorough brake check and determined brakes were operational and the fluid could have been there previously. We also made 3 stops on our flight and brakes worked flawlessly. We also did not see any missing cowl fasteners on pre-flight. One fastener was loose but still adequately securing the cowling. During our inspection of the nose landing gear during pre-flight we did not see or feel any abnormalities.I immediately grounded the aircraft on our club scheduling system and contacted the aircraft owner who said he would look into it and correct any discrepancies. Had I seen the FAA tag before our flight I would not have flown the aircraft. The tag was attached inconspicuously to the bottom of the cover and neither I nor the other commercial rated pilot saw it while we were removing the cover. We also did not see any items we considered un-airworthy during our pre-flight inspection or run up. I would recommend the FAA contact an aircraft owner by most expeditious means available using the aircraft registry or airport authority if they ground an aircraft. The Airport Manager has contact info for all planes based on the field. This aircraft is operated by a flying club whose website and phone numbers are easily accessible. I would also recommend that tags be attached to a conspicuous part of the aircraft like a wing tie down point or handle.",,"After removing the canopy cover; we proceeded with the pre-flight inspection. We noticed some evidence of brake hydraulic fluid leak; but subsequent test of the brakes indicated normal braking action; so we decided to proceed with the flight (the purpose of which was a checkout in make and model).

Our first day ended when the airfield closed; because we delayed several hours due to insufficient support for two aircraft and a single fuel truck in operation. From the time we completed our aircraft preflight procedures and briefing; approximately 2 hours had passed. I was the Pilot Flying (PF) in the right seat and the Captain (CA) was the Pilot Monitoring (PM) in the left seat. There were two additional First Officers (FO) seated in the observer seats. The company pages for Ellsworth AFB states that for departures 'expect taxi clearance to runway via Taxiway Delta and back taxi.' There is further information provided for the arrivals section that states this is due to pavement degradation. This expected clearance is exactly what the company aircraft in front of us received the day prior; and is what we briefed. When we received our taxi clearance we were simply told to taxi via 'Alpha Bravo.' As we commenced our taxi there was a marshaller positioned directly in front of us; and he signaled for us to taxi straight ahead; then directed us for an immediate right turn towards DELTA Taxiway. As we were nearing the runway; the FO in the left observer seat reminded me to turn left onto Alpha; which the entire crew agreed with. As we turned down the taxiway; it appeared to be very close to some blast fences on the right; so with the CA's concurrence I opted to taxi left of the center line so we had ample wingtip clearance on the right side. This area where we were taxiing was a large (vacant) parking ramp. This Taxiway Alpha has a slight right turn; then a left turn back to parallel the runway. As we made this right turn (approximately 45 deg) I immediately realized something was wrong. The taxiway had a dead end directly in front of us; and the blue taxiway lights were now on our left side. I quickly came to a stop and we queried Ground Control; while referencing our taxi diagram. The crew thought that perhaps the blue taxiway lights were center line taxi lights; and the Ground Control commented that those lights 'used to be green.' The crew further interpreted this to be center line taxi lights; so we again continued to taxi to the left to intercept what we thought was center line taxi lights. We again realized this was not the case; and these recessed lights denoted the right side of the taxiway. We crossed over the recessed taxi edge lights onto the appropriate taxiway; and continued our taxi to Runway 31 without any further issues. At no time did the aircraft ever leave a hard surface or an area in which was not intended for aircraft travel; it was simply an area that was not specifically marked as the Alpha Taxiway. Where we were actually located was on a back alleyway for the hardstand parking locations of the ramp. Several factors played into this event; including the following; The long delay due to fueling issues; and duration from the time we briefed. Expectation bias originating from the company airport page and the marshaller/equipment in front of us. Poor taxi diagram available for the airfield which appears to identify two parallel Alpha taxiway lines; which is actually the taxi width line on the ramp area. Incorrect information from ground control concerning taxiway edge lights and colors versus taxiway center line lights; which did not exist. Poor ramp lighting and non standard airport markings.Even though we briefed what was expected and all monitoring pilots had taxi diagrams open and followed along the taxi route; we were still easily confused due to the information we had available. I believe that instead of 'expecting' a clearance to back taxi on the runway; this should be standard operating procedure at this airport. There are far too many hazards and traps with the limited information on this airfield and non standard markings.",,"PM (Pilot Monitoring) briefed taxi route per company page; via Delta and back-taxi to departure Runway 31. We were cleared by ATC to taxi via Alpha; Bravo. Upon signaling marshaller; we were directed onto Delta; the marshaller and a piece of equipment blocking a straight-out taxi. Prior to entering taxiway Delta I advised a left turn was necessary to enter taxiway Alpha 'Outer' there being two taxi lines depicted on the airport chart. A turn was made and we followed taxiway Alpha 'Outer' realizing; as we neared the curve in the taxiway that something was amiss. We stopped the aircraft; queried ATC; and were assured our taxi path was correct. Being situated behind the Captain (4th Observer) I did not have a good view of the taxiway ahead and to the right of the aircraft; however; I could see out the left window clearly. The Captain and I observed a wide swath of taxiway left of the aircraft; and the PM maneuvered accordingly. We joined taxiway Bravo at the runway end; and departed Runway 31. The non-standard markings; poor airfield and taxiway lighting; and operations of a military airfield were contributing factors. The marshaller put us on the wrong path initially by blocking a straight-out taxi. The two taxi 'lanes' for taxiway Alpha are misleading. There is no Jepp AMM (Airport Moving Map) for RCA making Ownship position a guesstimate. It seemed once we made the turn that we were taxing on the 'Outer' taxi lane for taxiway Alpha. ATC never stopped or queried us; and when we queried ATC we were given inaccurate information back. Additionally; we had observed a military aircraft take that path in advance of our departure; making it seem there were two; legitimate; taxi lines for taxiway Alpha. The company page could clarify the taxiway Alpha markings. Not being familiar with military airfields it looked as if there were two taxi lines for taxiway Alpha. Further; we could have pressed ATC for the suggested route of taxiway Delta with the back-taxi to the runway.",,"Air carrier First Officers reported difficulty locating the correct taxiway to the runway at RCA airport.

We were pushed very deep on the ramp at a slight angle facing our direction of proposed travel for Runway 08L. This was prior to sunrise (XB:54am local time) and the ramp area was extremely dark. During the push back we were cleared to start engines. During the start of Eng 2...we [were] distracted by an ECAM message. ENG 2 OIL TEMP LOW. The new hire first officer was startled with this ECAM. I was explaining to him this was normal during cold weather starts; was when the aircraft reached it stopping location of the push back. After the push back crew left to return to the terminal; we started to taxi making a left turn. We were verifying the #2 Engine was now at normal temperature. Its then I noticed the lack of a taxi surface markings anywhere in front of the aircraft. I quickly check our position on the (Airport Information) page; only to find accuracy was off and our position was showing somewhere between Taxiway NI and N (which would have been on the other side of the blue lights).I started a small left turn then corrected with a hard left turn. At this time I noticed that the ramp/taxiway edge surface marking was to the right of the aircraft. I continued over to and joined Taxiway N1. There is a very wide hard surface area between the edge line and the blue taxi lights. With the deep push from the ground crew; we had inevitably started to taxi between the edge line and the blue taxi lights in the dark. We joined Taxiway N1 at this time. Distraction with engine start ECAM and loss of exact aircraft position with deep push back. Only using taxi light on extremely dark ramp (should have used more of the lights than I had available (Turnoff/landing).

In addition to the normal items; I learned a habit to scroll through the synoptic system pages and look for abnormal numbers; etc. When I did this; I noticed that the right hydraulic system was down to 6% fluid capacity. A few minutes later the system continued to drop to 4%. I shut off the DCMP (DC Motor Pump); a DC-powered pump that backs up the motor-driven pump; to see if that would stop the loss of fluid. That seemed to stop it as the fluid level stopped dropping.At this point; I was pretty sure that we would soon be getting a Right Side Hydraulic Pressure Low Yellow EICAS message and lose the right-side system; so I asked the FO (First Officer) to open and review the procedure for this with me. We reviewed the procedure and prepared for the possible loss of the RH hydraulic system. I have had a RH hydraulic system failure 2x before in the Challenger 300 aircraft. There are two systems and the RH is the least critical. If you lose the RH hydraulic system; the gear extension is unaffected. Flaps must be lowered using alternate flaps; and will take a lot longer to deploy. Also; you won't have all of the spoilers and reverse thrust on the affected side.When we began our descent into ZZZ; the RH system was still operational and had 2 - 4% fluid left. I asked ZZZ Approach for the longest runway; just in case. While being vectored on downwind for the ILS; way sooner than normal; I slowed the aircraft so that we could lower the flaps. I was expecting the system to go when we lowered the flaps to 10; but was surprised to get the flaps to the second detent; 20; and get the gear down with the RH system still functioning normally. At this point; if I hadn't scrolled through the synoptic pages and seen the hydraulic level; I would not have known there was a problem. At the final approach fix; we intercepted the glideslope and I asked for full flaps; flaps 30. That was when the system lost pressure. 4 or 5 EICAS yellow warnings went off at the same time. Hydraulic pressure low; spoilers INOP; etc.; etc. The flaps also stopped traveling halfway between 20 and 30. I instructed the FO to complete the procedure; which consisted of shutting off the hydraulic shut-off valve; and selected alternate flaps. The flaps did not continue to the full flap position. Fortunately; we knew this might happen and had prepared and briefed for it. I held a little extra speed over the numbers and landed smoothly. We had 12;000 ft. of runway; so I did not attempt to use the LH reversers. I used moderate braking and rolled to the end of the runway. We taxied in to the FBO with no more excitement.I recommend making a scan of the synoptic pages a normal part of the cruise checklist. If we had not done this and noticed that the RH hydraulic fluid was low; we would have been completely surprised when 4 or 5 caution EICAS messages all came on at the same time right after crossing the final approach fix.",,,,"CL-30 Captain reported a loss of hydraulic fluid in the right-hand hydraulic system during cruise.

While attempting to dislodge his right shoe from the rudder / brake pedal via negative back pressure; the left pedal was either inadvertently pressed or forced forward due to negative back pressure on the right pedal. This left pedal drive forced the airplane to veer off the left side of Runway XX onto Taxiway XX. The veer increased and caused the airplane to spin 180 degrees off the south side of the taxiway into the gravel. Upon crossing the taxiway on to the gravel; the right prop struck a taxiway / runway light; destroying the light and minorly damaging the prop. Lesson learned.

Except for at about the 10 NM out point as I recall; I never heard any other traffic in or around ZZZ though I could hear traffic at neighboring airports - mostly reporting positions in and around ZZZ1. On short final; another pilot reported that he had just been 'cut-off' so was executing a 'go around'. The only part of his aircraft identification I remember was 'Aircraft Y' and a reference in his transmission to the airport name of ZZZ1 but then he corrected himself to say ZZZ. I acknowledged that I must have been the aircraft that 'cut him off' and apologized. He stated that he had been making radio calls for the last 10 minutes and didn't I hear him. I stated that I had as well and asked if he didn't hear me as I was genuinely curious if he could not hear me. The other pilot never responded but only 'keyed his mic'. I am unable to provide an estimated miss distance as I never actually saw the other aircraft either before or after the incident. After taxiing to the parking area; I entered the FBO building and asked the employee behind the desk if he had been monitoring the radio and whether he heard the radio communication from either aircraft. The employee stated that he had been monitoring the radio but that it had been consistently unintelligible. While talking to the employee; an aircraft made a radio transmission that I could hear over the employee's handheld radio. It was not understandable due to static and the employee stated something like 'like that'. After a few minutes; I departed ZZZ to return to home base airport. As I was departing; I heard the Aircraft Y pilot again making radio transmissions and referencing ZZZ1. During the weeks leading up to this incident; other pilots of the aircraft I was flying reported concerns with the radio equipment. On the day of the incident; I conducted a radio check prior to departure from home base. On the 3rd attempt; another aircraft responded that they could hear me fine. I am uncertain if either of the two aircraft pilots operating in the pattern at the airport of departure heard my first two attempts at a radio check and just never responded or if the 3rd attempt was the first attempt that the responding pilot heard. On the day after the incident in question; the aircraft was flown by another pilot to a nearby towered airfield and reported that the Tower reported 'garbled' communication from the Com #1 and nothing on Com #2 though the pilot reported reception on Com #1 was 'fine'.

Before and during the flight; I briefed the person on various safety procedures including the three-way exchange of controls and keeping his feet on the ground during take-off and landing so as to not touch the brakes. During the final landing at the end of the flight; I had control of the aircraft and landed on Runway XXL at ZZZ. Immediately after touchdown; the discovery flight customer held the left brake; sending the plane aggressively to the east side of the runway and into the grass. After several attempts to tell the passenger to take their foot off the brake; they released the brake. At that point we were about 10 ft. into the grass; I choose to keep the stick back and slowly brake so as not to slide on the wet grass. We safely made it to the taxiway turn-off after paralleling the runway in the grass for what I would say is 6 seconds. There was no visible damage to the plane and both the discovery flight customer and I were completely fine with no injuries. I believe what can be done to prevent a similar occurrence in the future is to have a dedicated time before the flight to talk and brief the customer more in-depth on safety procedures.

A few hundred feet after takeoff we were in IMC conditions. At 400 ft.; the aircraft commanded a turn I was not expecting. Once the incident was over; we realized that we had the wrong heading in the heading select; which caused a 180-degree turn to the right when reaching 400 ft. When the Captain realized the unintended turn; they continued the turn to the right to stay clear of terrain. They became disoriented and asked for a heading that was not going towards our course. They then asked to be put into LNAV without putting our second fix at the top of the legs page; so they created another 360-degree turn to try to fly to our first point over the airfield. I missed this mistake in my cross-check.After they recognized this mistake; they asked to be put back in heading mode and while doing so they banked the aircraft to 45 degrees. I pointed out the error and helped the Captain get oriented again. We continued our climb and got on course while staying away from terrain during this entire event. We also always maintained an appropriate airspeed the entire time. As we debriefed this event when we reached cruise; the Captain felt that this happened due to rushing to take off before our clearance void time; which caused us to miss the error of having the wrong heading in heading select. They also felt that it was caused by not properly using the autopilot during a high workload environment. Also; of course; taking off at XA00 in the dark; in a rain storm; [and] without ATC present added an additional level of difficulty.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported a wrong heading input that was not caught during cross-check led to disorientation and unintended turns during a departure in moderate rain and night conditions.

During the enroute phase of the flight; both Captain (CA) and First Officer (FO) continuously monitored the weather and runway conditions at FNT. The reported conditions at the field were better than 6000 rvr and OVC at 700 ft. with braking action reported as 5/5/5 for Runway 09. The FO contacted Tower on the second radio early in order to obtain any PIREPs or actual field conditions. Tower reported the conditions as advertised. We elected to use Flaps 45 as a safety precaution and briefed full reverser use on touchdown. Runway 09 ILS was in use and the approach went smoothly. As we broke out at approximately 300 ft. AGL and executed a normal landing. I immediately recognized braking action was poor and not as advertised as we touched down. I initiated full reversers and did not actuate steering tiller as I knew it would possibly cause the aircraft to spin or slide. I could feel the aircraft sliding straight down the center of the runway. I kept full reversers engaged until I felt the aircraft was safely slow enough to brake harder. The aircraft still slid about 50 yards or more. The aircraft came to a full stop with less than 1/3 runway remaining. I set the parking brake and immediately requested a tow. FNT does not have the capability to tow; so the snow clearing vehicles came out and proceeded to clear runway and taxiway in front of us and we were then authorized to taxi after Tower; the plow vehicles and myself all concurred that it was safe to do so. We arrived safely at the gate with no further problems.Weather conditions were not as reported and advertised by FNT tower. Continue to request PIREPS and even more updated field conditions.",,"Today; upon landing in Flint; Michigan; the stated braking action reported values were much higher than in reality. The Captain and I thoroughly looked at the weather in ZZZ before departing as there was forecasted snow; low visibilities and ceilings forecasted. We departed ZZZ without incident. During flight; we began to get updated weather information for Flint and discussing our upcoming approach and landing. We determined from earlier briefings that flaps 45 would be the best option for the weather in Flint. The weather I printed off and listened to over the radio was saying 1/2SM visibility; 3500V5000 and overcast 700 ft; and 5;5;5 values for Runway 9. On the ATIS; they described this and also said that there had been another aircraft; I think it was an Aircraft X; which had come in and reported good to moderate braking action. I called up Tower about 50 miles out to ask about current field conditions and they corroborated what was on the current weather information and said that the visibility was 1/2 and 3500V5500 and that the braking action was 5;5;5. We descended and were configured at the outer marker to be as stable and precise as we could be for this approach. We commenced the approach and Tower was reporting over 6000 on the RVR. We came down to land; had the environment in sight roughly 150 ft. above minimums and continued in to land. The runway was a faint white color and had snow on it. The Captain landed the aircraft in a very stable manner in a controlled landing getting it onto the runway at a slow airspeed to maximize braking effectiveness. We touched down; they applied brakes and reverse thrust and then maximum reversers. The Captain maintained centerline very well. I offered to assist to hold the elevator full forward since they were on the reversers and brakes. The Captain stated that the runway was much less than 5;5;5's and that braking action was more towards poor to nil. They finally were able to stop the aircraft in over 4000 ft. of runway abeam to taxiway Alpha a fair amount more than the application had stated. They told Tower that they were not going to taxi further as this was a safety issue that could lead to an excursion since it was so slippery so we stopped on the runway and waited for operations. Tower sent out the trucks to work on getting the runway to a level where we could safely taxi to the terminal. As they were cleaning it; it was almost immediately covered again with the rates of snowfall. Eventually they heavily sanded the runway and taxiways to the ramp and we taxied very slowly to the ramp uneventfully. Tower ended up closing the runway after we landed for quite a while to try to get it treated.Due to heavy snowfall; the braking action reports were not up to date with current conditions. Having more accurate braking reports would be greatly beneficial when there hasn't been an air carrier coming in to land in awhile.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported runway condition was incorrectly reported and resulted in landing with poor to nil braking with loss of aircraft control.",

He informed me that the Stabilizer Trim had failed on his side also; so I proceeded to the QRH and after reviewing the index I ran the Stabilizer Trim Inoperative procedure. Also; at this point the Controller was directing us to proceed to a fix on the departure SID and I told him that I thought we should [request priority handling] and get a vector towards the airport since I didn't want to get too far away from ZZZ airport with a possible flight control issue. The Captain flew the aircraft to landing and I handled all the administrative tasks. I was quite busy. He asked me to load the ILS approach for XXC which I did and then I sent an ACARS message informing the Company we were returning to the airport for landing due to a flight control issue. I spoke with the Flight Attendants and informed them that we were making a precautionary landing in 10 minutes and to prepare for that and that we expected an uneventful landing. At this point there was some confusion on my part because the Captain asked me to check the box and extend for Runway XXR and I hesitated because I wasn't aware the runway had changed. After I questioned him about it; he cleared the matter up and I loaded and extended off the appropriate navigation fix. At this point; we were on final and I had several more tasks to perform and we both decided the proper order would be based on the Aviate; Navigate; Communicate model. So; I deferred making the PA and ran the before landing flow and on recall the Speed Trim Light annunciated. I quickly ran that checklist for that procedure and then completed the before landing checklist. Next; I made a quick PA to the Passengers and then I got our landing clearance and backed-up the Captain as Monitoring Pilot.The causal factor was all mechanical and we reacted to the given situation. However; I felt as though the recent changes to our procedures added a little bit of uncertainty affecting the ingrained habit patterns that I'd developed over numerous years flying the 737. In my opinion this allowed me to go from normal workload to becoming overloaded quicker than if I was better trained on the new procedures at the flight training center. I spent a lot of my off time reviewing the new procedures so I could perform them as the procedures presented them but felt that formal training for such a big change would've been ideal and more proper.I completed all the tasks and checklists required but did get to a point where I was task saturated running all the checklists; procedures and cabin communications. My opinion is that the recent change to the procedures without formal training allowed me to go from a normal workload to becoming overloaded much faster than I would have. Also; I noticed that I ran an additional checklist that wasn't necessary; I ran the Speed Trim Fail checklist that annunciated as I did a Recall as we turned final. The Stabilizer Trim Inoperative checklist Additional Information section states: that after the Stab Trim cutout switches are placed in CUTOUT; the SPEED TRIM FAIL light may illuminate. I believe I was [becoming overloaded] at the point I saw the annunciation of the SPEED TRIM FAIL light so I ran that procedure unnecessarily adding to my workload.",,,,"B737 First Officer reported Main Stabilizer Trim Fail on climb.

During cruise flight at (estimated) XA45Z the autopilot disengaged because of a #1 IRU failure. This caused my attitude indications and nav indications to disappear from my display screens. I immediately transferred control of the aircraft to the First Officer who became the Flying Pilot for the remainder of the flight. I proceeded to perform the ECAM actions; which were minimal; other than noting failures and clearing the items on the ECAM display. The normal procedure for recovering flight instruments is to place the ATT HDG control on the Switching Panel to CAPT 3. But because the #3 IRU was inoperative; this action did nothing. After finishing the ECAM actions I advised ATC that we had a flight control problem and that we needed to descend to a lower altitude (to clear RVSM airspace) and that we would get back to them when able. We were given clearance to FL260 but decided to level at FL280 after it was offered by ATC. I was unable to contact Dispatch via the Crew Phone application on my iPad because I did not have WIFI capability. I assume this was because of the double IRU failure; but I have not confirmed this assumption. We were too far east of the ZZZ1 area Dispatch Direct VHF Network; so I spent a few minutes locating the appropriate communications frequency for our location in order to get a phone patch to the Flight Dispatcher. After explaining the situation to Dispatch; we decided that a diversion to ZZZ2 would be the safest course of action. We then advised ATC of our plan and proceed to ZZZ2 airport. As a result of the loss of 2 IRU units; the inoperative aircraft systems were Autopilot; Auto Thrust; Flight Directors; and Yaw Damper #1. The weather for the entire flight; from failure to landing; was VMC. We did not have navigation ability; so we were given radar vectors all the way to the localizer for Runway XXR at ZZZ2. We decided not to request priority handling for this situation as we felt the aircraft was fully controllable; the weather was good; and a normal landing was anticipated. The flight landed without further problems and proceeded to park normally at the assigned gate. An IRU failure on its own would not have caused any significant problems or the necessity to divert. However because of the inoperative #3 IRU; this became a much more problematic situation. I do not know the reason for the failure of the #1 IRU so I have no insight as to the causal factors beyond the application of an MEL to the #3 IRU. I believe this was a very rare occurrence. The failure of a second IRU unit is obviously considered a low probability event. Otherwise the MEL application would not be approved. I do not have any suggestions on how to prevent this type of event in the future.",,"IR3 was differed item before the flight; I checked the procedures during preflight and complied. We were cruising FL350; autopilot disconnected; initially I thought the Captain disconnected auto pilot inadvertently. Then Captain asked me what happened; from their question I realized it was a problem with the aircraft. I told him 'YOUR AIRPLANE' Captain replied back 'Your airplane I don't have instruments indications'. I took the airplane; and radios; I asked the Captain if I should request priority handling they replied no; not at this moment. I called ATC and I told them we had a problem with degraded flight controls; and no auto flight system; Controller asked me if I was requesting priority handling; I told ATC no; and that we were troubleshooting the problem and would keep them updated. I requested to descend to FL260 to leave RVSM airspace and it was approved; I also advised ATC that I might not be as accurate as the autopilot to maintain altitude and heading they replied it was not a problem; they were very helpful on the situation. On the Captain's side 'NO Quick Action; No ECAM Exemption; it was ECAM Action. I commanded ECAM ACTIONS.... Captain completed ECAM ACTIONS.IR3 was a deferred item in the MEL and we lost IR 1; having only IR 2 working only. The Captain briefed the Flight Attendants about the situation. Dispatch send us new paperwork for flying at FL260. The Captain checked the documents and told me we were good with fuel and weather to continue to ZZZ3; I suggested to deviate to ZZZ2 instead since it was closer and we could not take a chance; they considered my advice and agreed. They took the communications back and requested the deviation to ZZZ2; weather conditions were good; night time; some crosswind; I requested to get briefed on details of the approach; reviewed the status and requested vectors to land; at gear down aircraft entered in Direct; controls were a bit different as expected. The Captain backed me up during the approach regarding speed and vertical descend and a safe landing was conducted; with no further problems arrived to the gate; switched airplane and continued our trip to ZZZ3.",,"A321 Flight Crew reported the failure of the #1 IRU after departure. #3 IRU was already on MEL.

After requesting priority handling; we followed the CABIN ALTITUDE procedure and deployed the O2 to the Passengers. I believe I asked for a descent to the lowest safe altitude and were cleared to 12;000 ft. We were not far from ZZZZ so I knew we would not be held above 10;000 ft. for very long due to the mountains in the area. I asked the FB (First Officer B) to run a non-normal overweight landing assessment.As I was completing the overweight landing checklist; the checklist indicated we needed to do a flaps 25 landing. However; the landing assessment indicated we needed to do a flaps 20 landing. This is where the confusion for me and the FO started....Both of us firmly believed that all overweight landings were done at flaps 20 yet the checklist indicated flaps 25.... Our belief was supported by the landing assessment completed by the FB from the 'non-normal' section of the landing app as I had instructed him to do.Not having any resolution with the conflicting information; I decided to complete the approach using flaps 20 since it provided a better margin of safety if a go around would have been necessary with one or two engines operating. This airport has terrain in proximity and the runway in use has an 'Engine failure Procedure' missed approach. Considering all of this; I was satisfied to continue the approach and landing at flaps 20...We held over the airport for a couple turns to complete our checklists then commenced our approach to XXR. 		Once we cleared the runway; we stopped on the inner taxiway so the Fire Chief could give us his report. Our Company Mechanic was the liaison to communicate with the Fire Chief...He used turbo fans to cool the gear then offered to hose off the landing gear with water. I did not know if water was appropriate with the gear as hot as it was so I asked Local Maintenance and Maintenance in ZZZ through the Sat-phone if I should give the Fire Chief the go-ahead. 	They offered no guidance. So I agreed with the Chief and they commenced with watering the hot landing gear down.I asked the FB to refer to the Brake Cooling chart in the QRH to get a time for cooling which was about 85 minutes. While we sat there five tires flattened out.Coordination with our Maintenance; Operations and Dispatch in ZZZ all worked well to see to our needs. Air stairs were provided along with busses to transport everyone to the terminal. I held everyone on the plane until the gear temperatures were in a safe range... Some of the difficulties with this event included communications with the Controller I was talking to initially at the start of the event. Her English was fine but the quality of her radio was horrible. I remember asking her a half a dozen times to repeat her clearance because we couldn't understand her. Day 0. XA15 ZAfter I submitted this report; the review page had errors.. The nose number should be Aircraft X. I don't know the tail number offhand.. The aircraft type is 777-300.Day 0 0XA21 ZThe date of the event... in Zulu time was Day 0.With regard to the pressurization issue; Maintenance will make the determination as to why it happened. I flew this aircraft a week earlier. When I showed up to the aircraft to begin that sequence; the cockpit was filled with Mechanics trying to clear three status messages. I believe they were for both Outflow Valves and one for Cabin Altitude. Regarding the procedures for the overweight landing... Having time to review the events; the biggest distraction for my decision making was my preconceived notion that flaps 20 is the setting for an overweight landing. My First Officer (FO) had the same perspective. Now having reviewed the procedure; I see that the flaps 20 landing is tied to a single engine landing and not a two engine landing. During our annual training we go through this exercise and it is always tied to an engine failure. I think this is why my convection for insisting on using flaps 20 was so strong. Adding to that; I asked the FB for a non-normal landing assessment which is the; Flaps 20 landing (overweight; etc.) failure.... Located in the non-normal category in the landing app. This also supported my decision for a flaps 20 landing...It is obvious now that it was the wrong place to go for that information. Using the Normal landing assessment for this abnormal situation was the place to go. Reviewing all of this in the aftermath of this event; it is obvious that flaps 25 was the appropriate flap setting.Some of the abnormal procedures as they are written are difficult to understand. In the heat of the moment; there were a couple of decision questions that I couldn't understand. Now after a careful review; I have a better understanding of this procedure but in the heat of the moment it was very confusing. Suggestions:Complete understanding of the checklist procedures.",,"This was a night takeoff out of ZZZZ and I was the FB (First Officer B) on this flight. Going into this flight we were advised that we needed to do an inflight check on the PACKs. The Captain talked to Dispatch to verify what we needed to do to accomplish the checks. The Captain mentioned that we needed to wait to chime the Flight Attendants (FAs) at 15;000 ft. due to mountainous terrain before they were let up to begin service. After the chime was made the First Officer (FO) noticed the Cabin Altitude was not scheduling appropriately; I think it was approximately around 9;200 ft. We all confirmed this was the case; we were still climbing along with the Cabin Altitude. When we hit 10;000 ft. on the Cabin Altitude we received the CABIN ALTITUDE Warning. The Alert was acknowledged; at that point I stated that we needed to get our oxygen mask on; which we all did. The Captain assigned the FO flying duties (the FO was already the pilot flying) and the Captain pulled out the QRC and started the CABIN ALTITUDE checklist from the card. We were still in the climb and needed to level off. The Captain asked if we all agreed if we were in an urgent situation and we did. The Captain [requested priority handling] and let ATC know that we needed to return to ZZZZ and level off and descend back down. We ultimately leveled off at FL210 but took some time to get back down below 9;000 ft. During this time the Captain had pushed the PASS OXYGEN switch since the Cabin Pressurization continued to climb (I think it topped out at approximately 12;600 ft.). During this time the Captain had me call the #1 FA and advise them that we lost our Cabin Pressurization and will be coming back to ZZZZ and doing a Precautionary Landing and to expect the fire trucks to be around. We would call them back with more information once we had time. We worked with ATC to get us to a minimum safe altitude and set up for a hold so we can run through the checklist. The captain asked me to run the landing distance for our weight which was approximately 638;000 pounds and an overweight landing. I proceeded to use the normal landing distance portion of the app and gave the weights the landing distance for the different brake configurations 3 through auto max; with a 5 - wet/good braking action and flaps 25 and a Pressure Altitude of 3;000 ft. After giving this information the Captain advised we needed to use Flaps 20 and I believe I said that is not an option and I was then directed to use the non-normal portion of the landing app. I pulled the information for FLAPS 20 Landing (overweight) and provided the landing distance with the before mentioned parameters. Going through the overweight landing checklist we all agreed that it would be a VREF 30 + additives (wind and gusts; 5 knots minimum) is above 170 kts. At that point VREF 25 was selected but still planned to use FLAPS 20 for landing. When doing the landing checklist; I mentioned that we will not be able to complete the checklist (unless we were to override; which I did not say) if we had VREF 25 and flaps set at 20. Since the plan was to land Flaps 20 it was then set to VREF 20. The FO made a nice landing using FLAPS 20 and auto max brakes and rolled out; while passing controls to the Captain around 60 kts; all the way to Taxiway X; which was 10;685 ft. down the runway.We started our taxi back to the gate and noticed our brake temps were hot. At this point the Captain stopped the aircraft; we talked to Ground and let them know we could not move; and the parking brake was not set. The Captain had us reference the QRH for the Recommended Brake Cooling Schedule and it appeared it would take approximately 85 minutes to cool. During this time the Fire Chief was already present; and they had checked our brakes; which were indeed hot. At this point the Fire Chief determined that they needed to cool the brakes with water and the team started to cool all the brakes with water. Eventually they were able to hook up a tow to ouraircraft and chock the wheels; so the captain and FO were no longer having to hold the brakes manually. Ultimately five of the tires' plugs opened to release the pressure in the tires. Since we were not able to taxi the Captain worked with Dispatch; since it was a little bit of a challenge due to the language differences; to get stairs; a lift for the wheelchairs; and busses so the Passengers can get off the aircraft and back to the terminal.Two more things to add about the Flight Attendants; they did a really good job of waiting for us to provide them with information vice calling us while we were in flight. Also; the Captain did a nice job trying to slow everything down; assign task; and keep all players in the loop.Cause: The loss of cabin altitude.Deciding to use flaps 20 and the use of the non-normal landing app and using flaps 20 overweight landing; vice just using the normal landing app and selecting flaps 25 or 30 if that is what is called for.Would help to have and overweight landing on the non-normal side of the landing app. Overweight landing is a non-normal and does place us in an emergency situation. It could give you the same answer as the normal side of the landing app; but maybe not cause any confusion. I now remember in training they had us pull up the non-normal side and note that there was not an overweight option on the landing app.Suggestions: If the cabin altitude were to hold and schedule correctly that would help. Maybe add overweight landing to the non-normal side of the landing app too.",,"Flight Crew reported loss of Cabin Pressure Control in climb. The Cabin Altitude climbed above 12;500 ft. and the O2 masks were deployed. The Flight Crew requested priority handling and immediately descended. The Flight Crew preformed an air turn back and made an overweight landing at departure airport.",

We were setup and briefed for the RNP-Z straight-in for Runway XX. The airport was using Runway XY and we were told to expect a visual approach to Runway XY. The weather was clear with calm winds and excellent visibility. The Captain who was pilot flying turned the flight director and Autopilot off and elected to hand-fly a visual approach from a right downwind for Runway XY. I confirmed that the landing data was the same for both Runways XX and XY.Abeam the airport in the downwind the captain began a slow descent from the 1500 ft. AGL pattern altitude. While on base; I was looking for traffic on final as well as traffic in the left downwind when I heard the '500' callout. I looked at the Primary Flight Display (PFD) and saw that we were at 500 ft. AGL and still in a turn on the base leg. At this point I believed that we flying an unstable approach. We were on a right base for Runway XY and there was traffic on a left downwind for Runway XY at the same time somewhere ahead of us that I did not have in sight. I was concerned that if I called for a 'missed approach' while on a base heading we might climb ahead into the path of the other aircraft in the downwind and cause a mid-air collision. I decided that the safest decision was to not call a missed approach and allow the Captain to continue the turn to final. I did call out 'you're too low' two times and while I did not hear a verbal response; I did notice the Captain raising the nose and slowing the descent rate. While still in a bank to final; I noticed the radio altimeter (RA) was ranging between 230 and 270 ft. We came close to a radio Tower (a charted obstruction); and at one point we were so low that I was having difficulty seeing the runway environment. The airplane went wings level around 200 ft. AGL with 4 red lights on the PAPI which the Captain corrected for once on final. The rest of the landing was uneventful.While on the ground a ramp employee in ZZZ commented to me about the approach and said it looked like we got close to a radio Tower (the charted obstruction to the southeast of the airport). I also had communication with another airline deadheading Captain who stated that her and her First Officer both had concerns with how low we were and the stability of the approach. She stated they were looking at the replay of our flight on a flight tracking application to see how low we were.The Captain and I had very little interaction after the flight. I believed that flying so close to the ground and to obstructions was not safe or standard practice; and felt it was possible it violated a FAR. In ZZZ I reached out to a trusted check airmen for advice on how to handle the situation. After that conversation; I decided a report was appropriate. Upon returning to ZZZ1 from ZZZ I further expressed my concerns to the Captain and told him I wanted to file a report for the approach into ZZZ because of how the pattern was flown and how low we were. I also told him that another airline crew members and a ramp agent expressed concern as well. Based on that interaction; I contacted a Duty Officer.I had a moment of tunnel vision looking for the traffic on final and in the downwind. Once I realized how low we were; it presented a hazard to go around while on a base heading due to other aircraft in the pattern. If I had realized earlier that we were going to be so low I could have been more assertive in having the plane extend downwind and maintain altitude for a longer final. There is also no training or guidance I'm aware of on how to go missed when you're not aligned with the runway and flying a visual pattern. It was unclear to me how best to handle the situation given the unusual circumstances. Once on final with 4 reds on the PAPI I should have called for a missed approach based on the entire pattern flown. I made call outs about our altitude being low; but looking back I wish I had been more assertive and used more urgency in my tone of voicedue to how low we were flying.",,,,"Air carrier First Officer reported the Captain flew an unstable approach that was too low to the ground. It was not until the 4 red PAPI lights were in sight that the Captain corrected the flight path.",

I attempted to trouble shoot while continuing to turn left base for Runway XX. I noticed no popped circuit breakers and I was unable to even retract flaps to fully up position; so I requested a go-around with tower. Tower asked if I'd stay with them or go back to terminal I said I'd stay with tower and in the traffic pattern VFR to run numbers to prepare for a no-flaps landing. I maintained 2;000 feet as requested by Tower to stay in right close traffic while running numbers I needed for a no flaps landing. Approximately 5 minutes later; I landed at ZZZ safely with flaps stuck in the takeoff position. Have to prepare for a potential no flaps landing. But after realizing the flaps were stuck in takeoff position without being able to retract it to fully up position; I made the PIC decision to land using the no flaps landing data I calculated from the POH since that data is more restrictive.",,,,"Beech 1900 Captain reported Trailing Edge Flaps stuck in takeoff position during approach.

The landing gear was lowered. The Main Gear Lights Illuminated; but he Nose Gear Light did not. I attempted to trouble shoot for possible bad connection at light socket by wiggling the failed light but this did not make light illuminate. I then cycled the Gear several times but light did not illuminate. I then raised the gear and slowed the aircraft down to approximately 95 kts. and redeployed the Landing Gear several more times but this did not correct the issue. I then performed the alternate procedure to lower Landing Gear by pushing down on the Landing Gear Override Lever which would release Hydraulic Pressure and deploy the gear by gravity. This also did not make light illuminate. I then asked Tower for low approach flyby so that Tower could determine if Landing Gear was down. While on short final for low flyby Tower reported that all three of the Landing Gear appeared to be down and asked if I wanted to make a full stop landing.I assumed that the bulb may have burnt out and decided to continue to land. I touched down softly on the mains and waited to see if nose gear would hold as air speed dropped the nose began to drop lower than normal; so I attempted to add power and takeoff. I felt the blades of the prop touch the runway surface and determined that attempting a go-around would not be a safe maneuver especially considering that I was carrying passengers so I pulled the power back proceeded to land with a collapsed nose gear. In retrospect; when the Tower informed me that all of the gear appeared to be down; it affected my decision making and caused me to change my predetermined plan to flyby and caused me to abruptly abandon any further attempts to trouble shoot landing light.The Controller would not have been in a position to determine if the gear was fully extended without seeing gear from the side view of the aircraft. Had I completed the flyby perhaps Controller may had seen that the Nose Gear was not fully extended; and I may had continued to trouble shoot or at least made an attempt to bounce the Mains on runway to get Nose Gear to lock and illuminate the light. Also I may had been more prepared to anticipate the Nose Gear not being locked and may have been able to perform a go-around prior to blades hitting runway.",,,,"PA-32 pilot reported Nose Landing Gear failed to extend on final approach when the landing gear selector was moved to the down position.

Please do not dismiss this report due to its length; and please understand that the workforce has all but stopped submitting reports on this issue because it's been so long since the issues were brought up.MDT is a level 7 Combined Tower with Radar/TRACON. The airport and surrounding airspace is Class Delta with an overlying TRSA. Although MDT is not as busy as some major airports in the US; there are several times during the day where commercial/corporate traffic is considerable; typically alternating between waves of IFR arrivals and departures. The traffic levels and passenger enplanements are well above the threshold for Class Charlie airspace; but the airport retains an outdated and inherently unsafe combination of Class Delta and TRSA airspace. The primary reason for this report aims to address the unsafe condition which exists at MDT created by the lack of Class Charlie airspace. MDT Class Delta airspace extends from the surface to 2;800 ft. with typical lateral dimensions. In addition; it is combined with the nearby CXY airport Class Delta airspace; which in itself creates a more complicated airspace structure in the area.It is not uncommon for VFR traffic in the vicinity of MDT to overfly the airport and surrounding areas at altitudes as low as 3;000 ft. some even to the very lowest they can to remain above the MDT Class Delta. This is particularly unsafe as MDT departures are vectored out of MDT with an initial climb to 3;000 ft. and these VFR aircraft are under no obligation to participate in the ATC system while in the overlying TRSA airspace. Not only that; but these same VFR targets will often unknowingly be on the MDT final approach path which can often extend to 15 miles at altitudes that are in direct conflict with arrival aircraft. This is again particularly unsafe as two way radio communication is not required of these aircraft which often leaves the Controllers and Pilots of MDT arrivals guessing at what these targets will do.There have been repeated TCAS RAs issued to aircraft that are departing from or arriving to MDT; even if the Controllers working at the time can identify the potential conflicts. The proximity of the IFR departures and arrivals to these non-participating VFR targets is unacceptable and risk prone; especially at an airport where the commercial/corporate traffic is predictably elevated at certain times of the day. In the best case scenario; IFR aircraft (including commercial traffic) is being held on the ground (or vectored off on approach) to avoid conflicts with traffic since ATC cannot be certain of its movement. In the worst cases; traffic in being put into a situation where evasive action is required to avoid NMAC proximity. The implications for traffic without a TCAS system is obvious; and serious. Other unacceptable results of this outdated airspace are unstable approaches; missed approaches; increased workload during critical phases of flight; and Traffic management initiatives being disrupted. If these disruptions were caused by UAS systems; this issue would have national attention and the most serious of responses; yet it's being caused by a clearly and easily preventable issue and no changes have been made. Class Charlie airspace would allow Controllers to predict and control the path and altitude of any aircraft that is transitioning this airspace; and prevent these uncontrolled airplanes from stopping departures; arrivals; and causing much larger aircraft from making abrupt evasive maneuvers. Pilots of the non-participating aircraft are also at risk; whether they are aware of their location or not. It may be deceptive to GA pilots and similar users who are looking at the sectional chart and seeing only Class Delta airspace when in reality MDT is far busier and has far more passenger enplanements than a large amount of already established Class Charlie airports in the NAS. This is particularly relevant on days where VMC prevails and a large increase in VFR flights occurs.So many airports that are far slower than MDT with far less commercial traffic have Class Charlie airspace; yet MDT does not. This issue has been reported; mandatory when the situation requires it; and voluntarily several times. Even if these events do not occur daily; we are trying to convey how easily a very dangerous situation could develop. We are always learning from the past in aviation; and in this case; the problem we are facing is not new; and has caused serious sometimes fatal incidents in other locations in the NAS. Once again; the recommendation is that Class C airspace be implemented at MDT. Steps have been taken in the past to make these changes; including a staff study; an Ad-Hoc airspace committee comprised of members of the public; and at every turn the parties have agreed that Class C airspace is needed asap. This issue exists every day; 100% of the time. Controller actions are preventing bigger issues from happening; but we are one mistake or one delayed controller/pilot response away from big issues.I do not wish to bog down the reporting system; but at the same time; it seems that not submitting anything is also not the correct action to take.",,,,"MDT TRACON Controller reported numerous conflicts occur between VFR aircraft not in communication with ATC and IFR aircraft on their final approach course. This is reportedly an ongoing issue and the reporter suggested the MDT airspace should be redesigned as a Class C.",

The weather was low IFR due to a snowstorm that spanned most of the mountain region. There was significant ice on the airplane as it had sat for the previous 12+ hours in this snowstorm. During walk around; there was a truck at the gate to de-ice the airplane's windshields and engine inlets. I was told we would receive the remainder of de-icing completed at the pad. We arrived at the de-ice pad and it took more than an hour for de-icing to be completed. After takeoff from XXL; we entered the clouds fairly quickly and attempted to engage the Autopilot - it did not work. We then attempted it again; and shortly thereafter received the Flight Control Alternate Law Message Caution on the ECAM display. We executed the standard ECAM procedures and noted no follow up actions for this ECAM. No others information was available to troubleshoot the procedure and no background information indicated why the aircraft had reverted to Alternate Law. As we continued our climb; the Captain transferred controls to me while he began coordinating with Dispatch and Maintenance to further determine what was wrong with the aircraft and to develop a game plan. We leveled off at FL230 to initially remain in clear air and avoid climbing into RVSM since we did not have a functioning Autopilot. Due to snowstorms throughout the plains region; the Captain coordinated with Dispatch for a suitable divert and briefed the Flight Attendants on our situation. We chose ZZZ2 for our divert as it was the closest field with suitable facilities that was not under winter IFR conditions. In-flight; we discussed; ad nauseam; the procedures for landing in Alternate Law; including considerations for reversion to Direct Law once the landing gear was lowered. Enroute; we [requested priority handling] and coordinated with applicable ATC agencies. After setting up the aircraft for our divert; the Captain assumed flying duties once again; and we eventually landed in ZZZ2 without incident. Upon landing; we received additional ECAM messages for CAPT AOA Probe and FO AOA Probe. These messages were never displayed in-flight. At several stages of the flight; the emergent situation was worsened as the Captain and I were still familiarizing ourselves with several procedural changes that were recently implemented outside of training cycles. In most cases we've found these changes to be minor; however the added stress of dealing with a flight control malfunction while digesting new call outs and altered habit patterns was non-ideal.Failure seems to be related to a mechanical failure of both AOA probes. I assume the likelihood of this occurring is low; and therefore this could potentially related to ice accumulation on the aircraft prior to departure.",,,,"A321 First Officer reported autopilot failure on climb; with the aircraft reporting a Flight Control Alternate Law ECAM Caution Message.

I was monitoring all positions to the best of my ability; but also had traffic I was working at the Sector 1 position. I heard Sector 3 coordinating with ZZZ about a [priority] aircraft; when the Sector 3 controller advised me from across the room that I was probably going to want to pay close attention to the [priority aircraft] he had inbound because it could be a pretty bad situation that was developing. I had the remote handset plugged in to my headset and heard the Center Controller passing information along to the Sector 3 Controller about an EPIC aircraft that was inbound that would require a long runway and long approach to that runway. The Center Controller passed along the phone number of an instructor for the pilot of the EPIC aircraft; because they needed a support in talking them down and through the equipment issue they were troubleshooting.I was able to record all the critical information related to the [problem] as the Center Controller passed it to the Sector 3 controller; as well as the phone number of the instructor who needed to get in contact with the pilot of the aircraft. This resulted in a full page of notes as I was also working aircraft at the Sector 4. I then had to step away from the Sector 4 to call back the only controller left in the building to come and split off Sector 2 and Sector 4. In the meantime; critical time was passing before I could call the instructor to be able to get additional information to pass along to the aircraft in distress. I was able to brief the next controller at Sector 4; and then call the instructor; before sitting next to the Sector 3 controller to pass time sensitive instructions from the instructor to the pilot through the Sector 3 controller. Fortunately; the team functioned effectively together; and the pilot landed without incident. The entire scenario was extremely tense; though; and would not have been nearly as stressful had Sector 2 been able to be split all along.Sector 2 needs to be split as often as possible; if not all the time outside of midshift hours. But; we simply do not currently have the staffing to accommodate. As our operations continue to grow we need more staffing to ensure controllers are not put in these positions. We're already working 6 day workweeks with shortened breaks; and these types of safety issues require us to be at our peak. As we approach a busier traffic season; it will be increasingly more difficult for Sector 2 to be combined with any other radar position as consistently as it currently is and expect that controller to be able to maintain situational awareness of all sectors.

They told me they noticed that the altitudes did not show up in the approach for points MEYRS and YARUB. He entered 14800 ft. at MEYRS and then they entered 12000 ft. at YARUB. In flight; I quickly checked the altitudes and expectation bias kicked in. I remember seeing 12000 ft. at YARUB and thought that that altitude looked correct. At some point before we started the approach; the FO said that we didn't need the 12000 ft. restriction at MEYRS because we had a 12000 ft. restriction at the next point; COQKU. We were cleared to fly the approach by DEN Center and I descended in approach mode; autopilot on. All was fine over MEYRS but as I was descending to 12000 ft. we got an EGPWS; 'caution; terrain!' It was night time and both of us were wondering; 'what the...??' I clicked off the autopilot and leveled off and the FO reached up to put a higher altitude in the ALT window. We had 8600 ft. in there for the FAF EBIHE. Soon after; we got a radio call from DEN Center that they had a low altitude warning on us. By this time; we had traveled closer to YARUB and they told us that if we maintained at least 12000 ft. we were fine. It's one thing to have these warnings go off in the simulator at DENTK but it a whole other thing when it happens in real life at night and you can't see what's in front of you!! The rest of the approach and landing went uneventfully. After we parked at the gate and ran the parking checklist; we both took a very close look at the approach plate to see what happened.

The Approach was stable with Moderate turbulence / Gear down and Landing Checklist complete / Altitude call-outs standardCrosswind correction maintained directional control on runway center line and continued through left main gear touchdown and right main gear touchdown. During touchdown of the nose gear a wind gust caused my aircraft to weathervane to the left and begin to slide sideways. I corrected with opposite rudder and the aircraft re-aligned with the runway center momentarily. A second; stronger gust caused the aircraft to weathervane beyond my control movements of full rudder and full aileron. The aircraft began to slide at an approximate 45 degree angle to the runway. I was unable to correct on the ice-covered / snow-covered surface causing the Nose Wheel excursion into a snow bank adjacent to the west of Runway-XX. I immediately moved both Condition Levers to Cutoff and both Propeller Levers to Feather. Fortunately neither Propeller hit the snowbank. Contacted ZZZ Center and advised of the excursion and that Runway-XX was blocked. Contacted ZZZ2 Dispatcher advising of the situation and that there were no injuries to me and no apparent damage to the aircraft. Note: Upon exiting the aircraft I realized that the main gears were still on the runway surface and only the nose gear had exited the runway. I also realized that the runway surface was covered with a thin layer of ice under approximately 1/2' of crusty snow. I then examined the Propeller tips finding no damage and looked at the Nose Gear and Over-Steering block also finding no damage.Approximately one day later: Further examination of the aircraft by Maintenance Supervisor revealed no damage and aircraft was released for return to service. This mishap happened immediately after touchdown. Runway Surface Contamination: Runway 100% contaminated with Ice and covered with Snow. Estimate FICON NIL-- Not reported / No NOTAM issued regarding Runway conditions. During touchdown a wind gust caused my aircraft to weathervane to the left and begin to slide sideways. I corrected with opposite rudder and aircraft re-aligned with the runway center momentarily.

I was unable to correct on the ice-covered / snow-covered surface causing the Nose Wheel excursion into a snow bank adjacent to the west of Runway-XX. If I had been informed of the Runway Surface conditions being NIL I would have proceeded to my Alternate.At our other small airport Out-Stations we have individuals on-sight at the airports we can call to receive first-hand verbal information regarding surface/runway conditions. This flight into ZZZ is a new destination used sporadically during peak times and only recently did it become a permanent stopover. While running this route; at no time has anyone been available for me to talk to. Calls to the airport manager result in voicemail. We need to find someone available for information. Talking with the airport manager the night of the incident he appeared reluctant to issue any NOTAMS.

As I started the takeoff roll; I hear over the CTAF that Cessna was going around. After a few seconds; I saw the Cessna fly overhead climbing on upwind. I still cannot believe I did not see anyone on final. My only thinking is that because I was perpendicular to the runway that the left leading edge of my wing blocked my view just enough so if the aircraft were a little right of course on final; I could not see them. After thousands of hours flying; this is the first time this has happened. Lesson learned. I will make sure that I am now angle slightly in the direction on the final approach so that I can clearly see any traffic that may be offset slightly. It could also be a slight visual error in that the airplane may have been on centerline but there might be a slight parallax error where the airplane would appear slightly off centerline on final.

There was no icing PIREPs and nothing was forecast near the airport. There was light icing depicted on the current chart on the weather website near the ZZZ airport at 3000 - 5000 ft. Based on PIREPs; cloud cover on the iPad; and our inbound flight; we determined that the cloud deck was only a thousand or so feet thick and not a concern for this flight. FO and I verified our TKS fluid was still full since we had just added fluid in ZZZ1; and briefed icing procedures and the flight profile. As we began descending for the RNAV XX approach; I charged the TKS system prior to entering IMC; and it coated the wing with fluid. We entered the clouds at about 4800 ft. I began noticing some trace ice and I activated the TKS system again to 'Norm'. Since I was pilot flying; FO was watching the wings and air frame; and called out light icing. By the time I was able to look out my window; the left wing leading edge was covered with about a half-inch thick of rime ice. This ice was slowly shedding on the outboard part of the wing; but the inboard icing was still built up. I asked FO to look at the tire; the wing; and tie down hook and tell me what they were getting and they advised me of an icing buildup everywhere. At this point as I was preparing to level from the descent; we hit SLDs (super cooled large droplets) which looked like a water balloon hit the windscreen. The water spread across the windshield and froze; obscuring my view outside. I activated TKS max flow air frame and windshield TKS fluid. Even on high; ice kept accumulating. I told FO to let ATC know we were in severe icing; which they did. ATC asked if we wanted to descend below the approach altitude and I said no because we were still IMC; and [requested priority handling] direct vectors to the final approach fix. ATC gave us a heading and I proceeded to turn. FO ran the remaining checklists while I verified the aircraft configuration; I disengaged the autopilot and began flying the course intercept; and pointed out our airspeed. We had been cruising at 147 kts. and were now at 143 kts. As we began descending on the glide path; our flaps-up airspeed further decayed to 130 kts. as the fastest we could get. I introduced flaps 10 degrees and they were introduced with no noticeable change in flight characteristics. There was no wind or turbulence of note. Inbound from the final approach fix; the aircraft rolled un-commanded to the right; left; and began shaking. I cycled the prop quickly to shed ice to 1600 RPM and back full. I crossed the threshold at 119 kts. I was able to land firmly on the 1000 ft. markers and only after landing turned off the TKS fluid.

The only PIREP at the time was for rime ice in the clouds. Obtained ATIS several times that morning. Called the Tower and they mentioned that snow was moving in but was not yet over the airport. I taxied to Runway XXL and also commenced a run-up. I was then cleared for take-off on Runway XXL and stayed in the left traffic pattern. Once airborne I noticed snow coming down from the clouds (virga) about 4 miles west of the airport. After 1 touch and go; I heard another airplane was cleared for take-off and they also decided to stay in the pattern. I was 'Cleared for the option' a second time while turning on downwind. Tower asked the [the other aircraft] how close the snow/virga looked. They said that it was 'pretty close'. Then the Tower amended my clearance to 'Clear to land'. At this point virga had not yet reached the airport area. At about 300 - 500 ft. after touchdown and while applying normal brake pressure the plane started to fish-tail. I took my feet off the brakes and the plane veered sharply to the left and exited the runway and onto the grass. While on the grass I was able to keep directional control with the rudder and brought the plane to a full stop. After receiving taxi clearance from the Tower I taxied on to the taxiway and back to the FBO. After parking I examined the aircraft and found no visible damage to any part of the aircraft including the propeller. I wrote up the incident on the Maintenance Squawk Sheet and then called the Tower to converse about the incident.

ATC cleared the B767 to take off and we were less than half a mile from touchdown. We observed the takeoff in order to avoid its wake turbulence. When we were about 5 or [so] ft. less to land; the left wing raised all of a sudden because of the wake turbulence and [the aircraft] touched down and got pushed to the right. The airplane steered to the right side of the runway and we ended up running over the grass on the runway side. We took action and throttled up the right engine to steer to the left and reached the runway again. We managed to taxi off Runway 10 and exit at [Taxiway] A3. Airport personnel approached us and checked the airplane and other ground personnel checked the runway and lights and informed and confirmed that we had not hit or damaged the runway lights. We are convinced that there was not enough spacing between the departing heavy jet and us landing after ATC cleared us to land. Also; there was another airplane coming behind us on final. For that reason; ATC called our base turn to accommodate for the other landing airplane. The outcome was no damage to the airport property; airplane; and passengers but this was a learning experience for all of us. Next time we will elect to reply to ATC that we are unable to continue with his instructions in order to avoid these kinds of situations. We strongly believe that ATC should give us priority to land and just wait 2 - 4 minutes during our landing and then release the heavy jet. It is just a matter of judging.

I immediately told them it was a right turn and they corrected the turn. There was no other issue with any other aircraft. Wrong turns are a systemic issue at ORD. At the time of this; the impact of the wrong turn was minimal. There are times when there is higher departure volume; and especially on a parallel departure runway configuration; where a wrong turn can be a much more serious issue. Recommendation - At this point; the only way anything will change is if the FAA and ORD Tower actually acknowledge that this is an issue; or if a wrong turn leads to a midair collision. Wrong turns off the departure end have been an ongoing issue for years. Any time an event gets any sort of attention; it gets swept under the rug; the impact is minimized; and the fact that there is 'no loss of separation' or that no accident occurred means that the issue is ignored until it happens again.",,,,"ORD Controller reported departure aircraft failure to follow departure clearance resulted in a wrong turn.

In the morning; these sectors are combined with the low sectors. We received a briefing that an aircraft inbound to PQI; an airport we provide approach clearances; had not yet been issued NOTAMs. The controller providing the relief briefing mentioned that there were runway closures when he looked earlier but it appeared they were open again. As the OJTI; I opened the NOTAMs on an adjacent Enroute Information Display System (ERIDs); not the sector in question; and I could see there were two runway closure NOTAMs. When checking the ERIDs at the sector in question; we saw no runway closure NOTAMs. To clarify when you open an approach plate; the NOTAMs are displayed below. The approach plate was open for the approach requested by the pilot so we could see the NOTAMs below and the runway closures were not included. Investigating further I finally noticed someone had typed '11' into the search field filter of the NOTAMs on the approach plate page. After testing; we removed the 11 and could then see the runway closure NOTAMs. In further testing; if you enter text into the search filter on the approach plate page; hit back on the ERIDs and re-enter the approach plate page; that filter will remain in place. Additionally; unless that text is cleared; any approach plate at any other airport will still include the search filter parameters.The text filter search button on the approach plate page of ERIDs should clear when exiting the approach plate page. The current functionality of ERIDs retaining the text in the search filter field could cause a controller to miss a NOTAM for a closed runway if they don't notice there is text entered into the search bar.

We were doing night flight training and my student wanted to do the river tour; where we fly along the river and get a good view of the city. The student asked if I could fly it so that they could look outside; which I accepted. I had done the tour many times. While flying up the river; we planned to go at 2500 ft. MSL; which would keep us above all buildings by well over 1000 ft. However; as we progressed down the river; the clouds got lower and lower (not forecasted); while they were initially above 3000 ft. MSL. With bravo airspace to my left and ZZZ1 delta airspace to my right; and with little time to get a clearance into either; my best option was to continue forward over the river at a lower altitude. Since I was fairly busy and the CFI in the back was following along on their sectional; I asked my CFI friend in the back what the highest building was in downtown ZZZ along the river that we hadn't yet passed; they said 1000 ft. MSL. So; I descended down to 2300 ft; and then 2100 ft. MSL for cloud clearance. However; right after we passed downtown ZZZ; my friend told me that in fact; there was a building they missed at 1300 ft. MSL. As a result; I realized (too late; obviously) that I had inadvertently violated 91.119; which requires that I fly at least 1000 ft. above all obstructions within a 2000 ft. radius. Fortunately; I was still 800 ft. above the building; and I was over the river; not directly over the building; so it was not a dangerous situation in this case. In fact; I may have been 2000 ft. away from the building laterally; in which case it would not be in violation of the regulation. However; it is easy to imagine a mistake like that resulting in a worse scenario; and it was certainly a mistake on my part regardless of if it was a violation. I was ultimately the PIC of the flight. No matter how experienced I am; and no matter how experienced my CFI friend helping out in the back was; the operation and safety of flight ultimately comes down to me.

At the time the Tower Controller was working both Tower and Ground frequencies with 5+ aircraft in the airspace and numerous others calling Ground. Student pilot checked in over the VFR reporting point requesting a full stop landing at the MLB airport. Tower Controller proceeded to reprimand the student pilot for 'stepping on' someone completing a read back. The read back was being broadcasted on MLB Ground; so we had no way of knowing someone else was communicating on Ground frequency as we were monitoring Tower. This is often a problem when the Tower is working both frequencies. The student pilot proceeded to repeat the call to Tower. Tower instructed the student pilot to enter a right base and report a two-mile base for Runway 9R. The student pilot read that back. Approaching a two-mile base the combined frequencies were so busy that we were unable to get a word in to report the two-mile right base. Approaching the extended centerlines for Runways 9L and 9R; the instructor (myself) and student noticed an aircraft on the opposite base heading directly at us. Two aircraft were approaching head on for opposite bases for parallel runways with no traffic advisory by ATC. The Controller seemed task saturated at the moment and multiple aircraft were not receiving clearances until short final. I (the instructor pilot) took over and deviated to the west to avoid a traffic conflict. At this point; we were trying to get in touch with Tower to notify the Controller of our position and that we were deviating for traffic. I got on the radio and called Tower notifying the Controller that we were approaching final for 9L deviating for traffic. Tower proceeded to reprimand us saying that deviation was unnecessary and that we were assigned the parallel Runway '9R'. I then initiated a right turn to reestablish on the final for Runway 9R with the opposing traffic in sight at all times; however this brought us close to the opposing traffic. It was determined that both myself and the student pilot believed we were cleared to approach Runway 9L when we were actually given 9R. At MLB; pilots are used to being given the same runway 95% of the time; so complacency played a role in us assuming we were supposed to approach Runway 9L. Additionally; we were distracted and startled as we were accepting the clearance for right base 9R after we got reprimanded for inadvertently stepping on an aircraft transmitting on a frequency that we were not required to monitor. This disturbance likely interfered with us mentally processing the non-standard approach clearance to Runway 9R. As we approached the two-mile reporting point; the Controller was so busy such that we could not get a word in to confirm our two-mile base and landing clearance. This led to the pressure and distraction that caused our brain's to default to the usual approach clearance to land 9L. To prevent a recurrence; pilots need to be vigilant when assigned approach clearances at VFR airports where they are complacent with getting the exact same clearance multiple times a day. Also; when a traffic conflict is present; pilots need to do everything possible to stay well clear of conflict. Additionally; Controllers should not reprimand pilots unnecessarily during critical phases of flight as this causes significant distraction in the cockpit that heightens the risk of pilot error. To ensure traffic de-confliction; the Controller workload and frequency should not get so busy as to prevent effective communication.",,"This event started at the visual reporting point for using '9R and 9L' at MLB. We reported at the point and were gripped at for stepping on someone else on frequency. The other aircraft we 'stepped on' was on the Ground frequency so we had no way of knowing as we were tuned into Tower. We then got clearance for 9R and report a 2 mile right base. Once we reached the reporting point the frequency was so busy we were unable to get any word. We continued on our base leg until we noticed another aircraft also on base leg from the other direction; while MLB does have parallel Runways 9R and 9L we got no traffic alerts for this traffic. The instructor took control and attempted to deviate west. The instructor notified Tower and told us to continue to 9R. The instructor then proceeded to intercept the final approach for 9R. During all of this we did come close to other traffic with having them in sight the whole time. We then proceeded to come to 9R where we asked Tower if we were still clear to land but he never gave us a response as the frequency was so busy. We ended up going around and landing on 9L. In order; to prevent situations like this happening again pilots need to make sure that they don't get complacent in critical phases of flight. Also; traffic alerts when 2 planes are both on base legs from opposite directions would be helpful so there is no confusion on where the other plane is going and everyone is going to the right runway.",,"Flight Instructor with student reported NMAC with another aircraft in traffic pattern that was complicated by a congested traffic pattern and busy tower frequency.",

These very large axles were loaded on pallets with wood cribbing to help hold it in place. During the inspection of the main deck it was noted that one of these pieces of wood was jammed into an adjacent pallets cargo containing chemicals. Upon initial inspection the substance was noted to be 'Syrine;' which the crewmember knew to be a chemical used in composite materials. It also stated it contained different forms of benzine and it listed hazards such as irritation.The crewmember alerted me and I came down and inspected the pallets. Our concern was the possibility of the cribbing rubbing and puncturing the container it was against. Further; we were concerned if there were undeclared dangerous goods. I contacted Dispatch and asked for a Dangerous Goods person to be brought into the loop. The Dispatcher said they would contact Operations who would talk to the station. This set up a circular loop; not really getting anyone new into the situation to evaluate it. After that call we located 6 other pallets with this same chemical and we were able to gain access to a clearer shot of the label with the full chemical name.I again returned and called Dispatch and asked to speak with a Dangerous Goods Specialist. This time I was placed in touch with what I believe was a Dangerous Goods Specialist. I passed along the name of the chemical and spelled it out. I wanted to know if the chemical should have been labeled as a dangerous good and be listed on the Dangerous Goods Form. The response was shocking; the deferred saying that they couldn't provide that information and that if I had a concern that I should pull it off. This provided no value for me in assessing the situation. Pulling the material off would have caused a major delay and would have been done simply because I was being provided no information.We had already consulted the Dangerous Goods Manual and found 'Styrene' but not the full name of 'Styrene DVB Copolymer.' I finally remembered the term MSDS and then conducted a search online to find an MSDS Sheet for Styrene DVB Copolymer and was able to locate one. I then reviewed the sheet and was able to determine the substance; though containing many chemicals that normally appear on the NOTOC was not classified as hazardous. The Loadmaster was also able to get the pallet flipped around so that the cribbing was not going to possibly puncture the container. We were nearly 4 hours late between the very late start for loading; the contractor's personnel not working; and issues with moving the pallets with the axles in the first place.Having no support from HQ and the Dangerous Goods Specialist was frustrating and didn't improve safety at all. It left us in a bind to figure it out for ourselves. This doesn't seem like a good plan.

The system would not show information pertaining to the time or predictive details of the flight. The Captain was the pilot monitoring in this case; so the Captain gave me both the flight controls and the radios. The Captain proceeded to do both the short and long resets of the FMGC 1. The reset of FMGC 1 was unsuccessful. The FMGC seemed to reset itself several times in flight and almost come back to functioning as normal; but eventually stayed in the partially failed condition. The Captain then wrote up the FMGC and sent a message to Maintenance about its condition. While reviewing the procedure we revived an IR (Inertial Reference) 3 position error message on the FMGC 1. Then we determined that the IR position was drifting a bit but was within acceptable limits. Shortly afterward we received a similar error about IR 2. We made the same determination about this system that it was within limits. We talked about possible issues with navigation and how we would handle it if they arose. We continued to watch the systems and brief the approach into ZZZ for [Runway] XXR. We determined that we would only use AP2 (Autopilot) on the approach and that we would continue to watch the systems for any other errors. No other errors seemed to appear on the descent and the first half of the approach. As we reached approximately 500 ft. on the approach; I disconnected the AP and started to hand-fly the aircraft. At this time the Captain noted that the speed bug had vanished. I continued to fly and noticed that the speed was beginning to drop off. I then noticed that the GS was beginning to show that we were low. I pitched the nose up to correct but the speed continued to drop. At that moment the GS warning came on; the Captain said to kick off the AT (Autothrottles); and I disconnected the AT and added power. After the descent was stabilized; I reestablished visually on the PAPI and landed the aircraft without further incident. Upon touchdown and rollout; the TERRAIN TERRAIN PULL UP EGPWS went off. Unsure what had caused this at the moment; I attributed it to the issue with the FMGC and we continued with the landing. After we landed; we were confused as to what happened; but decided to investigate it when we got to the gate. After parking at the gate and shutting down the aircraft; we went back over the events of the flight in an effort to determine what had happened. We then re-read the FMGC failure procedure and noted that the last page had a note that the AT would not work once the AP was turned off. We took a moment to think about how we could have missed this; noting that several other messages had popped up during the procedure; and the system had come back and failed several times during the flight. We made sure the FMGC was noted in the logbook and informed Maintenance before departing the plane.The fact that there had been several issues that popped up during the flight led to checklists and procedures to become interrupted. In the future I will be sure to get out my QRH and look at the procedure also; if the situation allows for it. The procedure was a very long one. It is very easy to become distracted by multiple situations accumulating. If I am ever in a similar situation; while in cruise flight where the task saturation is lowered; I will also get out my QRH and follow along with what is happening.",,"While in cruise flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ; FMGC 1 had a partial failure. The system would not show information pertaining to the time or predictive details of the flight. I was the pilot monitoring in this case; so I assigned the FO (First Officer) to work both the flight controls and the radios. I reviewed the "Single Latch with AP (Autopilot) and FD Still Available in Managed Modes on Both Sides" QRH XX - XX but in the process the FMGC 1 came back online; although temporary. It then failed again and I proceeded to do both the short and long resets of the FMGC 1. The reset of FMGC 1 was unsuccessful.

We determined that the IR position was drifting but was within acceptable limits. Shortly after; we received a similar error about IR 2. We made the same determination about this system that it was within limits. We backed up all navigation conventionally using manually tuned VORs and advised ATC that if we were off course; to advise us.We talked about possible issues with navigation and how we would handle it if they arose.

We determined that we would only use AP2 on the approach and that we would continue to watch the systems for any other errors.

As we reached approximately 500 ft. on the approach; the FO disconnected the AP and started to hand-fly the aircraft. At this time I noted that my speed bug had vanished. The airspeed was decreasing and the FO was getting low on the glideslope. The AT (Autothrottles) were not being responsive so I asked the FO to disconnect the autothrust and add power. The descent was stabilized and the FO landed normally and on speed without AT. After we landed; we were confused as to what happened; but decided to investigate it when we got to the gate.

The thrust reverser on the #2 engine was under MEL. During the engine #2 start we had an ignition fault that aborted the start. Contacted Dispatch and Maintenance before attempting a second start. The second start was successful. Then we had a #1 FD situation that also required us to contact Maintenance. Once that resolved we had to amend our release due to our fuel being below our planned minimum takeoff fuel. At that point of the flight; my First Officer and I were ready for anything to happen next.Due to the wet runway; we were going to do a TOGA takeoff with ZZZZ as a diversion field in case of problems. Around 800 ft. we got an ECAM indicating an exceedance engine #1 EGT of 650 [degrees] with a fuel flow 800 lb. over what engine #2 was showing. The thrust was decreased for the climb; bringing the EGT just below the max limit. Within 30 seconds; the EGT and the fuel flow started increasing again past the max limit. Being out of the overcast weather and still in the valley; we asked for a heading and leveled off at 8000 ft. and slowed to keep the EGT below the limit. Running the QRH and watching the way the EGT was moving; we realized that we had lost our ability to climb without running the risk of having to shut down the engine. Contacted Dispatch; explaining what was happening. We all agreed to make a precautionary landing in ZZZZ. Due to our reduced power settings we were able to keep EGT below the limit and therefore; stay out of the QRH. While flying towards ZZZZ we received a message from Dispatch asking us if we had declared an emergency. At this time I had not declared yet. ZZZZ Tower started acting as if we had declared; asking us for SOB and fuel - they even conducted a runway inspection after we landed! I got busy reviewing our fuel and weight situation and did not get a chance to readdress the need to declare. Still being below 10000 ft. at night with possibly an engine we may have to shut down; I decided that an overweight landing was safer than holding to burn fuel. We ran the QRH for an overweight landing and briefed the inflight crew members; as well as the passengers. Shortly after touchdown we had a #1 Engine Compressor Vane Fault message indicating a possible FADEC (Full Authority Digital Electronic Control) failure. Taxied to the gate at ZZZZ using power from #2 engine as per QRH.

My immediate suspicion was that a fuel pump had failed and I took the immediate actions to remedy the situation. When those actions did not remedy the situation; I noticed the manifold pressure dropping and the oil pressure indication of the right engine reading zero. I then decided to shut down the right engine and to run the appropriate checklist.Next; I alerted ATC that I was having an engine issue and needed to descend to 16000 ft. MSL. The controller issued me a descent to 16000 ft. MSL and asked if I needed assistance. After running the proper emergency checklist and securing engine checklist I asked for vectors and a descent to the ZZZ Airport. The controller then issued a heading and altitude to maintain and provided information on the weather and approach I could expect into the ZZZ Airport.

In speaking with Maintenance; I confirmed that at no time did I request deicing of the inlets and fans of the engines. Maintenance said that there should be no issue with engine starts provided that we followed the procedure in the SOP.

I determined that we were far enough to avoid ground equipment and other aircraft at the gate next to us; so I cleared them to disconnect. We had a wing walker next to us to make sure we were clear of all ground equipment. Using differential power and brakes I turned the aircraft hard to the right to give as much clearance as possible to equipment and aircraft on the gate. While I never felt like I lost control of the aircraft; it was going the direction I wanted; the nose wheel started to slide on the ice. I had complete control of the brakes; but I didn't feel that I needed them since the aircraft was traveling in the direction I wanted. Once clear of all equipment/aircraft; I straightened out the nose wheel and continued the taxi uneventfully. It was only later that I found out that the nose wheel was momentarily perpendicular to the direction of the aircraft travel; and that we slid approximately 5 to 10 ft; in the desired direction of travel.

The Captain returned after the external preflight; and stated that there was no ice on the aircraft; we discussed the weather and decided we would decide on deicing prior to push. There was a weight and balance issue prior to push so the Captain went up top to talk to the Ops Agent. The FO walked to mid cabin and looked at the wings through the fuselage windows. It didn't appear to have any ice on the wings at the time. The assessment was evidently incorrect; and some thin frost and ice had formed on top of the wing but wasn't noticed. Based on both assessments by the Captain and FO; we decided that deicing was not necessary. The Ground Crew pushed the aircraft back after we received the updated weight and balance; data and new release. The Ground Crew wasn't able to push us back far enough because of ice on the ramp. When the Captain began turning out of parking; the nose wheel; evidently skidded on the ice. The turn was made very slowly so I didn't notice any adverse conditions from the FO side. We taxied to the end of the runway and it was at that point a deadheading crew member in the back; called the Flight Attendants and told them that we needed to deice.

We monitored the ZZZ ATIS closely throughout the flight and called our Dispatcher for realtime info when we were about 3 hours out. The latest ATIS stated multiple taxiway closures but did not list any specific ones. We knew about the severe weather that had passed through and were concerned about the runway condition codes published. We were descending to 3000 ft. and were heading south approximately 10 miles from the runway when we were cleared to 2000 ft. and given a right turn to 270 followed by another right turn to intercept the localizer and then cleared for the ILS XXC. I was the pilot monitoring (PM); the First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF) and we had a Relief Pilot (Captain) on the jumpseat. At 2000 ft. we were IMC however it did not take long breakout on the glideslope. Approach was uneventful; and stable flown by the FO. The runway CC (condition codes) was recently updated to 5;5;5;5 and we discussed cleaning up on the runway at the end of the rollout if it appeared the taxiways contained clutter. The FO had selected autobrakes 3 for landing and we said we would exit the runway at a logical point depending on the condition of the runway as well as the taxiways. We also discussed allowing the jet to slow completely to taxi speed utilizing the autobrakes. On final; I queried the Tower regarding where they preferred we exit the runway and they said we could roll to the end and exit at the Taxiway X highspeed. I knew we had Taxiway XX; the other highspeed taxiway on the right side of XXC available to us as well. All of these contingencies were discussed among the 3 of us. Also; this was the only operating runway at the time and we could see airplanes lined up for takeoff and de ice. As stated; the approach was flown uneventfully to touchdown by the FO. On rollout; spoilers deployed normally and the airplane slowed nicely. The first 2/3 of the runway was dry and free of clutter. As we rolled out I could make out either snow; frost; ice or something glistening on the last approximately 1/3 of the runway. By this time we were approaching 50 knots and we were only a little past 1/2 down the runway. I mentioned in the cockpit that we have Taxiway XX available if the stuff on the runway looked problematic. At this time I queried Tower regarding where they wanted us to exit. They said we could exit right at the end of the runway which would be Taxiway X. I took control of the jet from the FO and instructed him to clean up the flight controls so they would not be contaminated by what I could tell was heavily cluttered taxi ways. Then the Tower came on the radio and told us to exit right on Taxiway XY. I was expecting to go to the end of the runway by now so I started wondering why the last second change and then could not see and XY taxiway sign. I asked the crew where XY is and they said we just passed it. OK; time for a clarification note. At this time the FO and Relief Pilot thought we passed XY when we actually passed XX. We landed on Runway XXC and XY does not touch XXC; it touches XXR; so Tower told us to exit on a Taxiway that did not touch our runway. The FO told Tower we missed XY and stated we can take Taxiway Y which the Tower then instructed us to do. The braking action on the runway the whole time was good. Taxiway Y is a 90 degree taxiway and there was a line of snow across the entrance from the runway being cleared. I slowed to the minimum speed I could use to make my right 90 degree turn and then planned to make the next left 90 degree turn onto Taxiway Z to proceed north toward our ramp. When I began to make my left 90 degree turn onto Taxiway Z; the nose of the airplane moved a little left and I could feel the nosegear turn but the jet was essentially going straight forward. I announced something likewe aren't turning and immediately straightened the nosegear and stood on the brakes. Then I announced that we aren't stopping. We did eventually come to a stop on the Taxiway Y centerline with the nose of the jet facing east and oriented slightly east of Taxiway Z. I set the brake and the FO informed Ground that we were unable to negotiate a left turn onto Taxiway Z due to ice and snow and that we would require assistance. There was discussions with ground regarding if I wanted to try taxiing onto Runway XXR to attempt to turn around and we all agreed that the appearance of that runway was unsuitable for taxi. We told Ground Control that we would call our company to bring a tug to pull us out and take to the ramp. Airplanes were still taking off of Runway XXC when the Tower asked us if we could pull up 20 feet or so because our tail was hanging over the XXC holdshort at Taxiway Y. I was dumbfounded that we could be over the hold short because I saw 1 or 2 airplanes take off Runway XXC. I had one of our Maintenance crew visually check our position and he confirmed that we were in fact over the hold short about 20 feet and monitored my very slow pull forward and let me know what I was clear of the hold short. Then our Maintenance attempted to join a lift tug with our nose gear to move the airplane but he was unable to get sufficient traction with the tug to engage the nose gear due to ice. There was some discussion of taxiing forward across Runway XXR and proceeding north on Taxiway A however one brake check by the Operations vehicle proved that the ice on the runway would not allow taxi. It was decided then that we would have to wait for liquid de ice to come and spray the taxiway and end of Runway XXR to allow me to taxi. The plan was to deice the route and taxi on Taxi Y onto Runway XXR; turn right and proceed approximately 50m south on Runway XXR and make a right turn on Taxiway XY and then another right turn onto Taxiway Z to proceed north to our ramp. A lot of time elapsed while waiting on the liquid deice when a dumptruck showed up with a broadcast spreader on the back and after some coordination with our Maintenance; he spread some material all over the area approximately 50m in front of the jet. Whatever he used; it worked great and the tug was able to hook up within 15-20 minutes. The airport had a truck with a rep onsite for consult however their communication was poor as the Tower/Ground had constant trouble communicating with him and we missed several opportunities for the tug to attempt a pushback onto Taxiway Z. With Runway XXC being the only operating runway; the Tower was reluctant to have us push back and possible render that runway unusable. While waiting for an opportunity to move; the same man who drove the dumptruck with the broadcast spreader showed up with a front end loader and proceeded to scrape the area infront of the jet so the tug could have traction as well as remove the ice/snow that bordered Taxiway Z that may hinder the pushback of the tug. Once he finished that; Runway XXC was closed and the airport began cleaning it up again and ops moved to XXL. Our tug then had no problem pushing us back onto Taxiway Z and then towed us north on Z to our ramp.; Cause: Inadequate information regarding taxiway condition and which were best suited for runway exit. Short fused change in runway exit instructions from Tower. Told to do one thing and then told to do something different with little time. Instructed to exit via a taxiway that did not exist for the runway in use. Solution: Publish standard taxi routes; publish taxiway condition and limit which taxiways are used to only the ones cleared; in this case; it appeared none of the exit taxiways had been cleared. We were cleared to exit at the runway end; once that instruction was given; because of the nature of the adverse conditions; the clearance should not have been changed in close; unless there is a safety of flight issue which is why I was thinking our instructions changed.",,"Uneventful flight from ZZZZ-ZZZ until landing rollout and clearing XXC after landing from a normal flight; approach; and hand flow ILS landing. We had discussed rolling all the way to the end to clear the runway at Taxiway X which ZZZ Tower approved. On landing roll; after the aircraft was at a taxi speed; we were is a position to safety exit at Taxiway XX; but before we could coordinate with ATC ZZZ Tower asked us to clear at XY. I told them 'WILCO'; and the Captain; Relief Pilot; and I started looking for Taxiway XY as we taxied past XX. We recognized some signage pointing to XY; but did not realize at the time Taxiway XY did not connect to Runway XXC. We told ZZZ Tower we were unable to clear at XY; but could exit the runway at Taxiway Y. They approved; and we exited XXC at Taxiway Y. After clearing at Taxiway Y; Taxiway Z was too icy to turn the aircraft north to taxi to the gate. The Captain stopped the aircraft in the Taxiway Y and Taxiway Z intersection slightly north of the taxi line facing east. We were unable to steer or reliably stop the aircraft; so we elected to set the parking break and wait for a tow-in to the gate. ZZZ Tower cleared an aircraft to take-off as we cleared the runway; but did not realize our tail was still in the runway clear zone by approximately 5 feet. ZZZ Tower asked us to pull forward; so we coordinated with ZZZ Tower and airfield management truck to clear the runway and then re-set the parking break to continue waiting for a tow-in. We started the APU and waited over 3 hours for Company Maintenance and airfield operations to remove enough ice from the taxiway in order for the tug to get enough leverage to back us onto XXC and then forward onto Taxiway Z and then to our parking spot.Cause: The confusion from the ZZZ Tower Controller about Taxiway XY being attached to Runway XXC; and the lack of communication about the condition of Taxiway Y and Z for our runway exit. Nowhere in the NOTAMs do they mention Taxiway Y or Z's condition.Solution: Better communication from the ground handler about adverse airfield conditions; and real time information from ZZZ Tower via ATIS about taxiway closures. Controllers should also be proactive about proper taxiways to use in adverse weather.",,"Air Carrier Pilot Crew reported during the landing roll-out ATC changed the taxiway they were to use to exit the runway. The problem; as reported by the pilots; the runway was much slicker than advertised and the jet began to slide out of control. The taxiway given by ATC does not have a connection to the runway and once stopped the jet needed a ground tug and snow removal equipment to proceed. The pilots stated; lack of information regarding runway condition and the late taxiway change complicated the situation.",

I mistakenly tuned to the wrong frequency and failed to double check with the approach chart. While getting vectors into ZZZ with approach control; we got cleared for the ILS Runway XXL approach. We were then told by approach control to switch to advisory frequency since the tower was no longer in operation. In our approach brief; we mentioned the anticipated threat of tower being closed. The minute weather had mentioned that there was snow removal in progress at the airport; but we assumed; seeing as it was past midnight; this may not have been accurate at our current arrival time. While established on the approach we eventually got fully configured prior to the FAF. We were currently in IMC and making position reports. We did not hear any replies; or anyone else on the frequency; but did not find this odd since it was past midnight local time. At the time there was some task saturation with conducting the approach in icing conditions at night; and not having flown the CRJ 900 frequently. As we were making position reports on the ILS; we eventually broke out from the IMC a couple hundred feet above our MDA. We then saw snow plows and snow brush trucks on the runway. After seeing this; we immediately conducted a go-around for the missed approach. After performing the missed approach and after running the appropriate checklists; we contacted approach to inform them we went missed due to snow plows on the runway. They asked if we had heard anything from the snow plows as we made our calls; and I replied that we had not; still under the assumption that we had the correct frequency. I did not know how to get in touch with the plows if they had not responded to CTAF; so went to my Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) to find the ops frequency. It was at this point that I finally double checked the frequency and realized my error. We corrected the issue with putting the correct frequency in COM 1 on the second approach attempt and gave the snow plows and trucks plenty of time to get off the runway so that we could land. The flight then landed safely in ZZZ without incident. Failed to double check; with the appropriate chart; that I in fact had the correct CTAF frequency input. I needed to double check the frequency that I input; especially seeing that; more than likely; there was not going to be any traffic in the area. With no other traffic; it would be unlikely that we would hear anyone else on the CTAF frequency; thus having the necessity to double check that we tuned the correct frequency.",,,,"CRJ-900 FO reported a critical ground conflict.

Descending approximately 300 fpm from 7500 ft.; I once slowed my descent for crossing traffic below; and a second time leveled at 5500 ft. for the aircraft involved. At the time my TCAS was showing that aircraft 800 ft. below at approximately 4700 ft.Unfortunately the CFI indicated he never saw me visually nor on his equipment as he and a student were practicing power on stalls. The EFB indicated they were climbing at over 900 fpm at approximately 160 mph when they got dangerously close to my aircraft flying level at 5500 ft.My equipment did give me a traffic warning at which time I immediately looked to my left knowing his path was east bound (mine being north of course). I expected to see him below my position and was surprised to see him at my altitude a few hundred feet to my left. It was then that they apparently saw me and banked right. A couple seconds after I made eye contact and the aircraft banked left a very nervous ATC controller came on and warned me to climb immediately due to traffic. Fortunately I was able to relieve the controller by stating I had eyes on the traffic. To my knowledge the other aircraft was not utilizing any flight following; and in email correspondence the other pilot indicated they didn't see me on their equipment nor visually when they commenced their climb. In retrospect; the CFI/Owner should certainly have his equipment checked immediately; as there is no reason I shouldn't have shown up on his equipment broadcasting ADS-B out and being in ATC radar. Moreover; even when not going from point A to B I believe it's even more important to contact ATC for a unique code as predictability of training aircraft altitude and direction is limited vs an aircraft flying from point A to B. Had he been in the system; it's possible ATC could have given him a heads up sooner. Granted their warning to me was late; but of course flight following guidance is on a time available and it was a nice sunny day so lots of activity so not faulting ATC.Hope that the best lesson is a reminder to a very seasoned pilot; from a relatively new but careful private pilot; to utilize all your resources for traffic avoidance; especially on a nice day.",,"During multiengine training with a new student we were performing Takeoff/Departure stalls.

Allowing a simple aural warning to cause a distraction and to mislead ourselves momentarily with thoughts of a larger problem. With snow and de-ice procedures initial thoughts of a sensor or probe etc. that might be frozen giving false indications. Most likely we were on the borderline weight limit of 309.0 kg for bank angle limits coupled with nose down trim to prevent excessive climb rate. Engaging the automation earlier would have helped. While hand flying didn't appear to have an issue; the ZZZ departure can be overload with a PM busy on radio and aircraft light enough for rapid climb and faster than normal acceleration with a speed limit on SID that borderlines flaps 1 and flaps up performance speed. Threats in future departures can be multiple frequency changes in a short distance while maintaining communication between pilot flying (PF) and PM in routine normal procedures.

The acting PIC asked me 'What do you suppose happened there?' I answered that I believed we were both on the rudder pedals. He replied that he did; in fact; have right rudder applied. I suspect when he released right rudder pressure; the left rudder became free and; since I was applying significant pressure on it; this caused the incursion. I had debriefed with the PIC before the flight; indicating if he said 'my controls' that I would relinquish them immediately. However; he had not indicated to me that he was planning to use the rudder during our landing; nor did he inform me he was on the rudder. I have learned that if I have an acting PIC with me and I am the pilot flying; I must be more specific about communication and use of the controls.",,,,"PA-28 pilot reported runway excursion during landing rollout.",

Once up-beam the 1000 foot markings on Runway XX/XX in the downwind leg; I configured the aircraft for landing with the 'Landing Checklist' as the student was flying. While performing the duties as a flight instructor I was somewhat distracted and do not recall checking the three green lights that would verify the landing gear was down. After reducing power and flaring; we touched-down; at which point we started to slide down center line of the runway and I became aware that we had landed without gear down. We then drifted to the right side of the runway and into the grass; where I shutoff the fuel to the engine and removed both the student and myself from the aircraft. No occupants on-board were injured; and no public property was damaged. The lesson I've learned from this; and my new rule flying complex aircraft moving forward; is to never descend below the traffic pattern altitude until the landing checklist has been completed; meaning it is not completed until landing gear is down; and do not continue past the runway threshold with the intent to land unless the landing gear down has been verified again; otherwise go around. After speaking to experienced pilots who also have been in this type of situation; they have shared lessons they have learned and rules they place upon themselves now to never allow a gear-up landing to occur again.",,,,"Flight Instructor on training flight with student reported a gear up landing.",

As well as a terrible smell; like burning rubber. I felt like there may have been a loss of power as well-but in retrospect; I'm unsure whether power loss actually occurred. After this; instinct and training took over. I radioed ZZZ Tower; [requested priority handling]; and said that I wanted to land on the Runway behind me. I turned to land on XXL and set up for a left-ish downwind. I had enough energy to either slip it down or perform a power off 180. There was an airliner on the Runway that wasn't able to move out of the way. I didn't want to hit them; so I looked for another spot and saw Runway XYL. There was another airliner on that Runway; but I judged that I had enough space to slip it down; land; and stop without hitting them. So I cut the power; landed on XYL; and cleared the Runway at Taxiway 1. Upon landing; I was in shock; the smell got worse in the cabin; so I shut everything down; grabbed my handheld radio; and exited the aircraft and told ZZZ Tower I was OK and clear of XYL. I am still trying to figure out what happened. I am still at the airport; I was able to find an A&P; and he is helping diagnose. I consulted with an avionics shop and there are no signs of an avionics fire. I'm also still somewhat in shock. And almost questioning my memory of what I saw. I think that more attention to aircraft maintenance; and going above and beyond the basic requirements (e.g.; an annual inspection) that the regulations specify would've helped prevent this. I haven't been happy with the quality of my flying club's maintenance. And I learned that my flying club hasn't asked our A&P to inspect the engine since our last annual.

We were doing pattern work at ZZZ; training my student on commercial landings. Our sixth lap in the pattern we planned and executed a power off 180 for training. The student got slow initially so I said to pitch for your best glide to give you the best chance in making it to the runway. On the base leg we were lower than optimal for a power off 180 so the options were to go around or to use flaps in ground effect in order to balloon to the chosen point. My student elected to use flaps to get us to our point which I agreed with. The student deployed the flaps in ground effect which I saw had little to no effect; this is when I executed a go around and added full power because the airspeed and altitude were too low. The inertia and slow speed of the plane caused us to keep sinking toward the ground at which point the left side of the horizontal stabilizer contacted an antenna; unknown to us at this point since it did not yaw the plane or cause any adverse flight characteristics. Our wheels then contacted the dirt around 550 ft. from the threshold of the runway. During the go around I kept the gear extended fearing that the gear could have been damaged from contacting the dirt and to troubleshoot (Gear still indicated 3 green and no disagreement). The traffic pattern was flown and I took the landing to make it as soft as possible to make sure the gear didn't fail as well as preparing for a go around in the case of a gear failure. We taxied back to the ramp and then noticed the damage on the horizontal stabilizer then. The contributing factor to this situation was not having enough energy/airspeed for the flaps to work and not going around sooner. This was caused due to the lack of strict personal minimums for power off 180s in this aircraft.",,"I was flying a Bonanza F33A at traffic pattern altitude here at ZZZ. Mid-field downwind I tuned into the weather frequency and was advised that the wind was 020 at 14kts. I was planning for a practice short approach (Power-off 180) into Runway XX (Direct headwind). At the 1000 ft. markers my instructor pulled power and I pitched over for best glide for my aircraft (105 kts). Due to the head wind I turned base as soon as I met my best glide airspeed. Turning base to final while doing my best to maintain my best glide I realized we were going to be ~500 ft. short of Runway XX. I had a short conversation with my instructor that I knew for sure I was going to be short; at that time my instructor informed me that the controls were mine and that it was my decision to make. I advised my instructor that go-around was an option but I also felt that if we got into ground effect and extended 1 notch of flaps; we could float enough to make the runway; my instructor concurred so we continued the short approach. At roughly 100 ft. AGL I initiated the flap extension and felt zero lift gained by the aircraft; the instructor immediately reached over my arm that was still on the flap switch and pushed full throttle. Due to being on the back of the power curve and the sink rate of the aircraft; we momentarily touched down ~500 ft. short of Runway XX in the dirt. Upon the touch in the dirt the instructor took the controls bringing us back airborne while avoiding the approach lighting system; once airborne the instructor handed the controls back to me and advised me to do a go around leaving the gear extended because they feared that the landing gear integrity may have been compromised due to the touchdown on dirt. The instructor advised me to fly the traffic pattern and they would take controls on final to do a real-life soft field; so the landing was as light as possible in case the gear actually was compromised. Upon the instructor landing (Normal roll out) we taxied back to the South ramp to park and to go fetch maintenance personnel to come inspect the landing gear for us. Once we shut the aircraft down and got out to go get a maintainer; we noticed damage to the horizontal stabilizer. Up until this point we had no idea that the aircraft struck anything or anything other than the landing gear (touching dirt) could have been damaged. At the time we seen the damage we had no idea what the aircraft came into contact with; nor would we have ever performed a go-around knowing there was damage there. It wasn't until ~1 hour later we were advised by the flight chief that we made contact with an antenna. The antenna made contact with the left side of the horizontal stabilizer of the aircraft. Both the instructor and I never heard or felt any contact; all the flight controls and flight characteristics seemed normal as well throughout the entire traffic pattern while preforming the go-around. As I am extremely disappointed in myself that I allowed this to happen. I did learn a tremendous amount about my comfort minimums and when to trust my gut on performing a go around much sooner; as well as the aircraft I was flying and the characteristics of it. I only have 2 hrs. in the aircraft but was under the impression it had much better float characteristics than it actually has.",,"Bonanza 33 flight instructor and student reported ground contact with object during power off landing maneuver.",

C182T in question was downed and Returned to Service (RTS) by maintenance and signed off several times previously that day and prior days for issues with ground steering and rudder trim. When the Instructor Pilot (IP) was handed the aircraft board by dispatch. He was advised by dispatch that the aircraft had just again been RTS and brought back up after issues with Nose wheel steering capability. Maintenance had reset the trim as the remedial action. Dispatch advised IP to be cautious about the nose wheel steering. A previous IP who had the aircraft before and downed it for maintenance advised; 'It is having trouble steering and taxing; but use of aerodynamic turning from the rudder at speed is acceptable; and when below aerodynamic steering capability; use of differential brakes is still acceptable.' IP and Student proceeded to preflight the aircraft per the approved checklist; and discussed the prudent course of action was to test the aircraft steering on ramp and make a decision then. A factor in the course of action was that the aircraft was RTS and signed off as airworthy minutes beforehand. Once the aircraft was started; Nosewheel steering was less than usual; but differential braking was certainly adequate to control the aircraft direction on ground. The 'Go' Decision was decided by the IP and Private Pilot Rated Student as controllablity felt acceptable. The Flight proceeded normally; however upon landing and taxing back; IP felt that the nose gear steering was still not where it should be. IP decided to down it for maintenance once again to have it re inspected by maintenance as IP did not feel it felt safe to continue without further inspection. In the write up; the IP wrote that the aircraft was having issues with the nose wheel steering specifically; and it did not appear to be any issue with the trim as it was not affected in flight. Later it was discovered by maintenance the aircraft had suffered greater damage than was previously found in other inspections and the aircraft had suffered a hard landing on the front nose gear on a different previous flight within the last several days that could have been hazardous if the aircraft had landed hard on the front landing gear during the flight with the IP and student on the day specified in the report. For clarity; the aircraft did not land on the nose wheel or land flat during the flight on the day specified in the report; an issue may have arisen if the airplane did land flat or front gear first. In future; the moment something is felt as not 100% the aircraft should be downed for maintenance and checked out. In hindsight; the IP should have aborted the flight on the taxi test instead of accepting the decreased steering performance; as it had an underlying issue beyond what was readily presently feel-able by the pilot.",,,,"Instructor Pilot reported the aircraft had nose wheel steering issues although it had been returned to service after maintenance action for the same issues.

The Pilot in Command was Person A; Aircraft X. Two souls were on board the aircraft. The origin of this flight took place at ZZZ. The departure time was XA00 UTC on Runway XX. The intended destination was ZZZ1 airport.The first leg of the flight was completed successfully; and the touchdown occurred at XA44 UTC using Runway XX. Departure from ZZZ1 took place at XB36 UTC from Runway XX. Aircraft X departed with 2 souls on board and 48 gallons of 100LL Avgas. Clearance was issued to enter the ZZZ2 airspace by ZZZ Approach at 2000 ft. southbound. By the time the aircraft reached ZZZ3; the oil pressure gauge began entering the yellow arch. As a safety precaution; a request was made to the ZZZ4 Tower for a higher altitude when crossing the large area of water following ZZZ5. ZZZ4 Tower initially asked if any assistance was needed. This was declined at the time. However; souls on board and fuel remaining were requested. After being handed off to the ZZZ Approach; permission to climb to 4;500 feet was granted; followed by permission to climb to 6;500 feet. Finally; the pilot's discretion was given for altitude. This; however; was shortly followed by a request for landing. ZZZ6 was offered; about 30 miles north of the aircraft's current location. This was declined; as crossing the water with unknown engine trouble was unfavorable. ZZZ7 and ZZZ8 were then offered. ZZZ7 was chosen; and a left turn was made toward the field. This airport was chosen; as it was known that ZZZ8 has a short Runway; poor lighting; and a congested area nearby with fuel tanks. ZZZ7 was determined to be the safest option. During the turn to the airport; the oil pressure gauge dangerously entered the red; indicating excessively high pressure. [Priority handling was requested]; and instructions to expect Runway XXR at ZZZ7 were given. A descent was made from 5;500 feet; and at XC24 UTC; a successful landing was made on Runway XXR at ZZZ7.

The Piper was entering the pattern at the same time I was preparing to turn downwind from crosswind. As I began turning a left downwind for Runway XX; the Piper was in front of me and above about 100 feet. I observed the Piper through my windshield and my TCAS system alerted that the traffic was within 100 ft. I made a radio call; leveled my altitude; and made a radio call to alert the Piper and continued to landing as normal Runway XX. The Piper followed in behind me without incident. I believe the Piper meant to enter a 4 midfield left downwind; but entered the pattern much earlier than intended. The Piper was also above me in a low wing airplane and descending into the pattern; and I don't believe the Piper ever saw me until I made a radio call. In addition; the radio call outs from the Piper seemed non standard and vague; and one even mentioned 'ZZZ1'; making it difficult to pinpoint the Pipers location and intentions. What could prevent this is a standard pattern entry from the Piper; and being at pattern entry altitude well before the pattern entry would have made it more likely the Piper would have seen me. Standard radio callouts are very helpful. I will begin making radio callouts during the crosswind leg. I will begin leveling out and flying a square crosswind to downwind turn to increase my own visibility to entering traffic.",,,,"Pilot reported an NMAC event during landing pattern practice with another aircraft entering the pattern for different runway.",

On this day; I agreed to be a safety pilot for a student at the flight school; while they flew 'Under the Hood'. This was my first time acting as a safety pilot for this student. They were issued a Piper PA28-181. Our plan was to fly to ZZZ; ZZZ1; which was approximately 51 miles from our location. From the beginning; I must confess; I have only had 1 familiarization flight; and 2 additional flights in this type of aircraft; however; I was very proficient with its avionics. One of the things I noticed right off the bat; before taking off; was that the student did not have a checklist for this aircraft; and so I pulled out the POH to at least verify the speeds of the aircraft; while they proceeded to 'download' a checklist on their iPad. After fueling; we took off real close to XA00z. Immediately I noticed that they were was not using their airspeed indicator to climb via Vx or Vy; but simply establish a 500 FPM climb. I also noticed they did not use the turn coordinator to make standard rate turns; and after questioning them about it; I come to understand that they did not understand the basic fundamentals of the turn coordinator.We proceeded to ZZZ; flew the ILS for Runway XR and completed 1 full stop landing; and then proceeded to fly the approach 2 more times; with 1 touch and go; and 1 missed approach; with the intention of proceeding back to ZZZ2. On the way back; we established with ZZZ Center that we would like the RNAV GPS YYR approach into ZZZ2; beginning at ZZZZZ; and were 'Cleared Direct; ZZZZZ' by the Controller. Approximately 5 NM approaching ZZZZZ; at approximately 2000 MSL / AGL the engine begins to 'sputter' and lose power. It appeared the student began to panic; and did not follow any checklist; or execute the simple ABCD's (Pitch for best glide; identify best place to land; complete checklist; or declare an emergency). I assumed control of the aircraft; pitched for best glide speed; and steered the aircraft to line up with the highway which was the closest; 'safe' place to land. After checking the throttle mixture settings; and looking at the instruments I could see from my seat; I decided to call for [priority handling]. I could not see the fuel indicators; as they were on the far side of the instrument panel; and the panel did not have adequate lighting for me to see it from my position; anyway.After calling; and declaring my intentions to head for the highway; a voice came over the radio and said 'check the fuel system.' At this point; I asked the student if they had switched the tanks. They did not respond to this question; so I then instructed them to 'switch the tank.' They reached down; and I heard the tanks switch; and within a couple of seconds; the engine came back to life; and I immediately pitched for Vy; and the aircraft began to climb.

On the third hop the flight test was a simple area waypoint mission within 250M of the flight deck to evaluate the in-flight behavior and make the pilot aware of normal patterns flown on this type of mission using specific automated flight tools.During this mission the aircraft executes a series of 'calibration' maneuvers that are unique to this sensor payload; and the attention of the PIC needs to be on the sUAS so as to prevent loss of line of sight/visual reference.While the sUAS was performing this maneuver; a small aircraft was heard in the distance about where the closest airport is located; and that aircraft was not visible. PIC was in a condition of scanning for traffic while also maintaining situational awareness and line of sight to the sUAS. This additional workload factor interrupted the PIC from conducting normal full 360 scans for about a min while the scans focused on looking for traffic while also maintaining line of sight to the sUAS.During that time; moving at the speed of the winds (280 at 12 knots) a low coastal cloud not visible over the 30M high tree line 50M west of the flight deck drifted into the operating area and the sUAS entered a flight condition less than prescribed by FAR 107.51 (c) and/or (d).  PIC terminated the autonomous flight test and manually flew the sUAS directly to the Landing Zone (LZ)  from a point 50M AGL and 220M away. PIC elected to manually fly and not use the predefined 'return to home' feature since that would have flown the aircraft up to 60M which would have further limited the visual reference ability of the PIC. While the sUAS was visible to the PIC the entire time it was airborne; the operation clearly was not FAR 107.51 compliant for about 1 min 30 seconds at the end of the mission.","Reporter indicated after landing the UAS they located the fixed wing aircraft using ADS-B.

The radial was put in the FMC and we realized that the course needed to be put in; not the radial. The FO (First Officer) continued to fly while the Captain ran the irregular checklist with the relief pilots. We determined that we should jettison fuel to reduce our landing weight. The Captain talked with Dispatch and Maintenance about our situation and options. They then informed Departure Control that we would need to jettison fuel; and they turned us to a westerly heading and descended us to 9;000 ft. We then were handed off to ZZZ Control and told them once we commenced jettison. We jettisoned approximately 50;000 lb. of fuel.We then completed all checklists and got vectors for RNAV XXR. We told ZZZ that we would be a high speed approach and requested Crash Fire Rescue meet us at the end of the runway. The Captain flew an 185-kt. no-flap approach and landing. The autobrakes were set to Max; and manual braking was applied after the initial deceleration. We cleared the runway at the end and were met by Fire Rescue. The parking brake was set until after the nose was chocked. The brake temperature chart showed we were in the Warning Zone and the Fire Chief confirmed that the brakes were extremely hot and one was smoking. Once the parking brake was released the temperatures stopped increasing and the Fire Chief was able to put fans near the brakes to expedite cooling. We had coordinated with Operations to have tug come tow us in.",,"The FO (First Officer) was the flying pilot. Takeoff was from Runway XXR using flaps 5.

The relief pilots briefed the FAs (Flight Attendant); and made the PAs to the passengers.Going through the NON NORMALS; the next step was to run the FUEL DUMP Checklist. ATC gave us a heading to where we were to dump the fuel. We dumped the entire center fuel tank. Approximately 50;000 lb. The next checklist that needed to be done was the Overweight Landing Checklist. We used the guide to calculate the runway distance required based on our situation. After doing this checklist; I assumed control of the aircraft. I then briefed a RNAV GPS Runway XXR approach. Due to the landing flaps being stuck between 1 - 5; we had an approach speed of 183 kt. The landing was uneventful. I rolled out to the end of Runway XXR. The ZZZ Fire Department was in place waiting for us. They chocked our wheels; and I released the parking brake.

We departed Runway XXR. The plane had three MELs in the flight deck - autopilot INOP; thrust reverser INOP; and gust lock INOP. We took off out of ZZZ. On climb-out; I went through my climb flow and found that cabin altitude was at 800 ft. As this seemed unusual as it should still be lower; I opened the QRH to the pressurization chart. At which point; I found that the delta p was close but the altitude in the cabin was closer to a much higher altitude - that of about 18;000 ft. in the chart. Coming through 10;000 ft. we got a buffet in the controls and heard a loud noise. We called the FA (Flight Attendant) and asked if they heard anything abnormal in the cabin; which she responded yes to. They said they thought it was the wings and we asked her to go look. At this point; ATC was passing off to another controller. We asked to stay on frequency; get a vector; and a level-off; at which we did at 15;000 ft. and advised ATC we needed roughly 5 minutes to troubleshoot and would get back to them. The FA then called back up saying there was a whistling noise coming from the main cabin door and service door; but the wings were fine. We then told ATC we would need to return to ZZZ. From there we asked the FA to take their jumpseat and fasten their seatbelt in case the door fully depressurized. Also; conducted a briefing and advised her about 25 minutes till on the ground. At the same time; we were overweight so opened the QRH to the overweight landing checklist and ran through that. We then had an FMS 1 Fail and a Pack 2 Overheat message. We pushed the Pack 2 Button out as the aircraft can pressurize on one pack till FL250. I sent Dispatch a message telling them we were returning to ZZZ for a possible overweight landing. We requested lower with ATC at this point to burn more fuel; and ended up down to 5;000 ft. During this; Person A was flying and I began to set up an approach back into ZZZ. We then requested [Runway] XXR to come back in and did the normal pre-landing checklists. We then came into land. We missed disengaging the yaw damper before landing as we typically disengage the autopilot and yaw damper at the same time and were task saturated. By the time we landed we were 300 lb. roughly under maximum landing weight and came into land. During landing the rudders were tightened up but had movement where we could align the plane to the runway and make a safe landing. Upon reaching the gate I noticed the yaw damper still on and we included it in our maintenance write-ups once the aircraft was back safely at the gate. Person B was the FA; unknown employee number. While we have a standard call of "yaw damper; autopilot disengaged; landing" in our books; due to task saturation and the autopilot being disengaged; we missed it. I believe we could add this into the landing checklist as a secondary level of verification.",,,,"EMB-145 First Officer reported the cabin altitude was unusual during the climb.

This was written up following standard protocol. Maintenance arrived at the aircraft and completed their procedures in order to return the aircraft to service. The flight continued as planned. In cruise an abnormal vibration was observed in the #2 Engine. This vibration was only an indication on the EICAS screen and was going from green to occasional yellow indication; but did not produce an EICAS Message/Caution/Warning. An exchange of flight controls occurred and the QRH procedure was followed for High Vibrations in the Engine. A few minutes after the QRH procedure was completed for Engine Vibration; a thud was heard from the right side of the airplane and N1 began decreasing. Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) then appeared to be increasing rapidly and was observed giving a Red indication. While I was watching the ITT rise; the Captain went right to securing the Engine; rather than running the QRC. We began a descent to a lower altitude; and controls were transferred over to the First Officer (FO). Following that; the Captain ran the QRH one engine inoperative approach and landing. In doing so; the QRC was missed for suspected engine damage. The QRH procedure was completed for single engine approach and landing. A diversion to ZZZ1 was decided and a landing was accomplished at the diversion airport without issue. Improper use of checklist. Speaking up when things appear to be done improperly is of upmost importance. Keep in mind standard procedure/protocol in emergencies. In post flight debriefing; it was decided that we actually should have suspected engine damage; rather than simply an engine failure. If something isn't completed in the proper order; I need to speak up. I should have said something and went back into querying about doing the QRC for suspected damage in flight",,"While preparing for departure the First Officer (FO) noticed a few nicks on Engine 2 N1 blades. I entered a discrepancy in the Maintenance log; ZZZ line Maintenance repaired the aircraft and returned it to service. While enroute we got an abnormal vibration on Engine 2. I turned the flight controls over to the FO and ran QRH ENGINE ABNORMAL VIBRATION. This fixed the problem. I took the controls back and we continued the cruise uneventfully for about 15 minutes. After that time Engine 2 made a popping noise; N1 spooled down; and an amber FAIL icon displayed over the Engine 2 N1 gauge. I again turned the controls over to the FO. Since there was rotation in both N1 and N2; I incorrectly thought that there was no engine damage and consequentially did not run the ENGINE FIRE; SEVERE DAMAGE; OR SEPARATION QRC. I was instead looking for the ENGINE 2 FAIL QRH. As I was doing this; I noticed the Interstage Turbine Temperature (ITT) rising rapidly to the Red Line; and went directly to securing the engine. I did this without running the QRH because of the time pressure that the rapidly rising ITT created.After securing the engine we [requested priority handling] and diverted to ZZZ1. During the descent I ran the ONE ENGINE INOPERATIVE APPROACH AND LANDING QRH. We asked for Crash Fire and Rescue (CFR) to be available on landing to ensure the aircraft was safe to taxi to the gate. We landed uneventfully. After CFR verified the aircraft was safe to taxi; we proceeded to the gate and deplaned. There were no passenger injuries; and I did not observe any video being recorded. In hindsight; my assessment of severe engine damage was incorrect. Since I did not know why the engine shut down; I should have considered it severely damaged and run the ENGINE FIRE; SEVERE DAMAGE; SEPARATION QRC. Additionally; I allowed the rapidly rising ITT influence my decision making towards turning the engine off rapidly to avoid an exceedance when I should have slowed down; allowed the exceedance and run the QRC. This self-imposed time pressure caused me to secure the engine without verification. Running the QRC gets one into the normal engine failure procedures and cadence.",,"ERJ 170/175 Flight Crew reported Engine #2 vibrations in flight.

We arrived at the aircraft for our departure from ZZZ when we began working through the multiple MELs. MEL 21-XX-XX-X was discussed and we could not locate the logbook entry required before each flight. Maintenance was notified and Contract Maintenance performed the test and logbook entry. We then had a Blower Fault ECAM which was prohibited per the MEL. Contract Maintenance came back to the airplane and the test was performed again clearing the Blower Fault. We had failed to notice that per MEL 21-XX-XX-X there was a note stating MEL 21-XX-XY must also be applied. This MEL was not on our paperwork. We arrived in ZZZZ and had coordinated with Maintenance Control to have Contract Maintenance there to perform the test. We received the Blower Fault with the test and Maintenance began troubleshooting the issue. Circuit Breaker AE02 was pulled and collared and the Mechanic stated this was not appropriate for MEL 21-XX-XX-X. The Mechanic worked with Maintenance and cleared the Blower Fault; pushed the Circuit Breaker in; and made a logbook entry per the MEL. While we were flying back to ZZZ we began researching the history of this further. There had been multiple transfers from MEL 21-XX-XX-Y to MEL 21-XX-XX-Z and finally the night before our flight to MEL 21-XX-XX-X. We believed this is where the Circuit Breaker issue was probably missed.

AGL on final approach for Runway XX into ZZZ. This resulted in field landing short of Runway XX. The landing did not result in any injuries and both Student and I were able to exit the aircraft through the pilot-side door and walk to the airport. Because the aircraft landed in a snow covered field; there was damage to the aircraft as the nose gear entered the snow and pulled the plane down to the ground. The plane remained upright. The flight began at approximately XA40 leaving from ZZZ. We filed an IFR flight from ZZZ-ZZZ1-ZZZ2-ZZZ3-ZZZ. This flight was the long-distance flight to meet the IFR training requirement for Student. Prior to the flight; a preflight inspection was completed verifying we had full-tanks of fuel to ensure we had the proper fuel onboard to complete the flight with 90 minutes of reserve fuel landing in ZZZ. During the preflight briefing; we discussed the route; weather conditions and frequencies to be expected along the route. All information suggested a routine flight with no concerns for weather. We taxied to Runway XX; successfully completed the runup; and agreed to depart. We departed ZZZ and climbed to an elevation of 5;000 MSL. We contacted ATC in the air and were cleared for the IFR flight as filed. The first leg of the flight from ZZZ to ZZZ1 ended in a low approach and we continued from ZZZ1 to ZZZ2. After the low approach at ZZZ1; we contacted ATC and continued to ZZZ2 for another low approach and continued to ZZZ3. As we approached ZZZ3; we were cleared for the RNAV XX approach and handed off to ZZZ3 Tower. We completed the low approach at ZZZ3 and cancelled the IFR flight plan. We were cleared to depart northwest directly to ZZZ. Conditions were VFR with unlimited ceilings and visibility. Temperature was approximately -5 F so the flight from ZZZ3 to ZZZ was conducted visually. We climbed to approximately 3;000 MSL and continued until we visually confirmed the airport. We reported on the CTAF; XXX.X approximately 10 miles to the southwest inbound for a left base for Runway XX to ZZZ. The winds at ZZZ were reporting 300 at 06 kts. Prior to entering the traffic pattern at ZZZ; Student conducted the C-GUMPS checklist (as we had previously done for each low approach prior to the FAF). As we entered the left base for Runway XX; Student made a radio call announcing inbound for XX and we performed the C-GUMPS checklist for a second time. We turned on a 2.5 mile final for Runway XX and we conducted and verified C-GUMPS for a final time. Student reduced power to 1800-1900 RPMS and trimmed for a 80 MPH; 500 FPM descent. At approximately; 500 ft. AGL; Student called a loss of engine power. He pulled the throttle back slowly and pushed forward slowly to get the engine to respond. The throttle was slightly retarded and then slowly pushed forward since we feared putting too much fuel and choking the engine. The engine didn't respond and didn't increase in power. With no increase in power and already losing 200 ft. since loss of power was notice; I determined the plane would not be able to reach the runway. I assisted on the yoke and noted that the plane needed to complete a landing in the snow field ahead and the most important consideration was clearing a fence in our path. The plane cleared the fence and I felt the plane touch down in the snow. Immediately upon landing in the snow the plane abruptly obtained a nose-down attitude and stopped. I confirmed there was no injuries and neither of us impacted the yoke; dashboard or windshield. We shut the master switch off and turned the key to off. We both unbuckled our seatbelts and had to exit the plane from the pilot door. The seats were in a forward position and gravity made it difficult to push the seats back. Outside of the aircraft; I confirmed that there were no obvious injuries andno pair was reported by either Student and myself. After calling the owner/operator of the aircraft we walked the remaining distance to the airport. Throughout the entire flight; I never observed a loss of oil pressure or any engine instrument reading outside of normal operations. We used carb heat on each low approach and on the final landing; but never observed any loss of power in the flight due to observed carburetor icing. Except for the unexpected loss of power on final; the flight was uneventful and there was never any obvious indication of the expected loss of power.",,,,"Cessna 172 Instructor Pilot reported engine power loss on short final and landed off-field short of the runway.

The airway clips a portion of that area; so ZZZ vectors IFR aircraft around the area when it is hot. I was prepared for this; as it was on ATIS when I departed and ZZZ did not vector an unreasonable distance from the route and shoreline. The problem is that; when this area is hot; it puts most piston singles in a relatively narrow area where pilots are in comfortable gliding range and a reasonable distance outside the restricted area. The Controller working the ZZZ/ZZZ1 area frequency; which I've noticed tends to be the busiest in the area; was busy; but not overly. As they were about to hand me off to the other area Controller; they gave me 2 traffic calls at 12 O'Clock. Two VFR Cessnas at 5500 ft; 500 ft. below; that were on frequency; at something like 2 miles and 5 miles away. I read back and started looking for them. They gave the same call to those aircraft; stating that a Grumman was at 6000 ft. at 12 O'Clock and my distance. The first Cessna read back 'six thousand;' which I clearly heard. Before I could say something; the second Cessna was also given the traffic call and stated where they were. The Controller then handed me off; having not corrected the Cessna that said 'six thousand.' As I was reading back the hand off; I noted that they should check the read back with the first Cessna as they said 'six thousand.' I then switched to the next frequency. As I was doing that; I saw the first Cessna clearly in a climb directly toward me. I immediately disengaged the autopilot and put the airplane in a climbing turn approximately 800 FPM and close to 40 degrees to the right. The Cessna seemed to then lower their nose and pass off my left. I told the area Controller that I was maneuvering to avoid and that there had been a problematic read back. They understood and stated to 'do what you need' and then when able to fly a heading to intercept the victor airway. I may have climbed to an indicated altitude of approximately 6200 ft. before returning back to my assigned altitude and assuring the aircraft was properly trimmed and reengaging the autopilot. I did not have to enter the restricted area; nor depart my assigned altitude by more than 300 ft; though I would not have hesitated to do either if I had needed to. I assume the previous Controller called the Cessna after I made my comment; but don't know.I understand that the VFR aircraft have lower; workload permitting priority; but sometimes I think the Controllers just are not tuning into what they are reading back quite enough to avoid this kind of issue. They also seem to prioritize separating commercial and corporate IFR airplanes to lighter piston ones; even though we are the ones usually seeing these situations more often. ZZZ Controllers are the best I've dealt with; but these issues need to be discussed. Additionally; the military needs to really figure out whether it needs to keep the restricted area at all; as it causes a lot of confusion with unfamiliar pilots when it is usually cold and it causes issues with traffic when hot.",,,,"Grumman AA5 Pilot reported they climbed and turned to avoid an opposite direction VFR aircraft which misunderstood ATC instructions and climbed to their altitude.",

Battery was on trickle charger; oil pan was plugged in for heat and a ceramic heater with duct was put to preheat the engine/cowling. Morning of flight; plane was looked over; all exterior lights still functioning and controls were checked. Plane was loaded with two family members. I filed IFR days in advance. Departed from ZZZ airport and picked up IFR airborne with ZZZ1 TRACON leaving 3000. I was intercepting the airway when I received my rerouting of 'Aircraft X cleared to the ZZZ2 airport; direct ZZZ3 then direct destination; climb and maintain 5000;' I read back my clearance. After being handed off to ZZZ TRACON; roughly 15 NM on the 292 bearing of ZZZ3; I started seeing indications of electrical. My temperature gauge in the plane started climbing excessively at one point indicating 200F. The audio panel and GPS equipment started showing 'rainbow' stripes and fading in and out as if it was blacked out. The reading on the ALT AMPS was 0. My electrical turn coordinator was also inoperative at the time during flight; indicated a red flag on the instrument. Communication between ZZZ TRACON and myself was scratchy; I could barely hear and I was unsure if they were able to hear me. ZZZ offered me lower altitude. In my head I was questioning if the cold temperatures affected the battery. I stated I would like to descend to 3000 ft. to better temperature in hopes to stop the problem. ZZZ TRACON asked me if I was declaring an emergency; I stated 'Negative Emergency' and just reassured I was requesting to return to ZZZ.After informing them of my electrical issue; I requested to return to ZZZ knowing the problem was electrical; nothing mechanic or power of engine. ZZZ TRACON offered to land at ZZZ1 to troubleshoot; but I believed returning to ZZZ with multiple diversion airports along the way was reasonable and provided me 'safe haven' to divert in worst case scenario. ZZZ [TRACON] asked if I could take the hand off to ZZZ1 TRACON in which I stated I could; they switched me to ZZZ1. In return to ZZZ; ZZZ1 asked if I could take the last hand off to their other frequency and if I could not they would work that sector; I informed them I could take the hand off. The Controller also asked me to confirm the state of emergency; and I reassured the Controller I was operating on backup battery and standby equipment; and I was 'Negative Emergency.' Over the ridge line just north of ZZZ4 field; Controller came across 'Aircraft X radar contact lost; state position and altitude.' I returned with the requested information. I cancelled my IFR on the ground via the 1-800 number to ZZZ1 TRACON. After returning to ZZZ; we checked the voltage on the battery and it read 8.5V. After discussing with fellow pilots and the primary owner of the plane; we contacted a maintenance shop on the field to inspect the alternator and voltage regulator to handle any replacements and/or fixes that are in need. The plane landed safely without injury or damage.

A little over an hour into the flight we were level at FL370; talking to ZZZZ Center; and the Relief Pilot was on first break. It was at this time the Captain and I felt a jolt; the airplane began to yaw; and a significant vibration began. We looked at the engine instruments and determined we had lost thrust on the Number 1 Engine with a rising EGT of 692 degrees at the time. The Captain was the Pilot Flying so they took control of the aircraft and called for the QRC and the Engine Fire; Severe Damage; Separation Checklist. After completing the appropriate QRC and Non-Normal checklists we [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center; requested FL250 (drift down ALT was 26700 ft. @ 244 kts); and decided to divert to ZZZZ1. At this point the Relief Pilot was back in the cockpit and the Captain delegated duties for them and myself to go over the checklists one more time; contact the Flight Attendants (FAs); contact Dispatch; monitor cross-feeding fuel; and set ourselves up for our approach into ZZZZ1. We had no center tank fuel so we did not dump fuel and our landing weight was 300;000 lbs. below maximum landing weight. We requested the ILS to Runway XX with an alternate missed approach of straight out runway heading and up to 3000 ft. Our arrival; approach; and landing were uneventful. After landing we stopped on the runway and had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Personnel inspect the exterior of the aircraft; especially our Number 1 Engine. Once they gave us the all clear we taxi to the gate without any issue.",,"While on my rest break; I both felt and heard a large shudder and airframe vibration from the left side of the aircraft at approximately XA:00 UTC. Assuming we had had an engine failure; I left the rest area to the forward galley to speak with the Purser. The Purser was unsure of what was going on and informed me they had been trying to call the flight deck but was unsuccessful. I told them that I believed we had had an engine failure and that they would call back for me when they were ready. I then took a Flight Attendant jump-seat in the forward galley and awaited the phone call from the flight deck which happened about a minute later. We set up for me to enter the flight deck and proceeded in once it was secure. Upon arrival to the flight deck I found that indeed the Left Engine had failed and was vibrating quite badly as we could feel the airframe vibrations. The Captain and First Officer had already accomplished the Severe Engine Damage QRC and Engine Fire QRH. We were also already in our descent to a safe drift-down altitude and diverting to ZZZZ1. After I was briefed on what was happening and what the plan was; I was tasked with trying to reach Dispatch over the SATCOM. After several attempts to reach Dispatch over SATCOM I had to give up after receiving no answer. The phone would dial but there would be no answer. I informed the rest of the crew that I was unable to reach Dispatch over SATCOM so the Captain sent an ACARS message when time allowed in the descent. After this I took a look at the QRC/QRH procedures that had been accomplished and verified that everything had been done and started to monitor our fuel balance. Once all of this had been done I was delegated to keep the Flight Attendants informed of what was going on and give them their briefing. After concurring with the Captain; it was determined that we had about 15 mins of flight time left to ZZZZ1 at this point; we would have the Flight Attendants prepare for an evacuation; and we had no special comments. I passed this information along to the Flight Attendants and then we briefed the ILS XX and prepared to land at ZZZZ1. The Captain briefed us using our briefing card and we discussed the threats of having an engine failure; night landing; and unfamiliar airport. We also discussed that once on the ground we would come to a complete stop on the runway and then once stopped I would make an announcement to the passengers to Remain Seated; Remain Seated and we would have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) inspect the Left Engine for any fire or cause for potential fire and then base our next steps after their findings. We then ran the deferred items Descent Checklist from the QRH. After we briefed and within the terminal area I identified the localizer for Runway XX and then quickly called to Door1L to update them on our time to touchdown which was about 5 minutes from that point. At this point we were on a downwind and being vectored for a 10 mile final for [Runway] XX. The Pilot Monitoring First Officer (FO) coordinated with ATC for a potential go around where we would need to fly runway heading up to 3000 ft. and this was approved if necessary. From here we continued to be vectored and set up for a flaps 20 landing as per the QRH and ran the deferred items Before Landing Checklist from the QRH. The Captain then made a stabilized approach and landing on Runway XX and stopped on the runway and accomplished what we had briefed in the air. I made a PA to the passengers to make them aware of the ARFF trucks approaching the airplane out of an abundance of caution and told them to remain seated. ARFF determined that there was no fire or fire hazard so we then coordinated with Dispatch about getting a gate which they already had and prepared to move the airplane under our own power to the gate. At this point I made another PA to the passengers informing them of this and that although we did have a gate it would take some time to get off the airplane as we would have to coordinate with Customs and that for the time being should remain seated until everything had been figured out. I then made a call to the Purser and told them the same information and that it would be a couple mins before getting to the gate but that there was currently no threat of an evacuation and would proceed to the gate as normal. Once clear of the runway; the FO accomplished the after landing flow; we taxied to the gate; set the parking break and accomplished the parking flow and checklist and then except leaving the fasten seat belt sign on as we did not want the passengers to unnecessarily get up until it was determined that they could. The Purser then called asking if it was okay to disarm the doors and allow them to be opened which we said yes to and then opened the flight deck door and began coordinating with Authorities and Airport Personnel what our next steps would be.",,"B767 flight crew reported a #1 Engine Failure in cruise followed by significant vibration.

Show up at the plane and it has 3 major MELs applied (no Autopilot; Inoperative Gust Lock; Thrust Reverser 1 INOP along with no RVSM or CAT2 capability). We briefed the effects of the MELs on the flight using the MEL manual and the substantially increased workload that would be required. 2 MELs required visual check of full elevator and thrust lever actuation prior to each flight. Had ADS-B failure at the gate that Maintenance worked thru upon arrival so we conducted another setup check as CBs had been pulled. All was good and we finished the rest of the loading; weight and balance entries and continued on thru push; takeoff and descent. Nothing out of the ordinary besides the aforementioned MELs. Descent and approach went fairly normally until passing thru around 2;200 ft. MSL. At that point the First Officer (FO) asked me if I was on the rudders to which I replied no. He mentioned they felt stiff and there was very little movement even after applying much pressure. The wind was light and nearly down the runway; we still had positive control so we elected to land. Only had one reverser so we applied heavier brake pressure and rolled out a little longer than usual. I took control of the bottoms and left him the tops until clear of the runway where I had him conduct the after landing check. No Gust Lock meant he still had yoke control while I taxied to the gate. I noticed the rudder pedals would turn when applying tiller for turns. Still had positive control so we proceeded to the gate. Decided to shut down the aircraft and restart as sometimes this will clear abnormalities. Once re powered; we had an issue with the pressurization panel where it displayed an A005 message and I couldn't select a landing field elevation. Had to pull/reset some CBs for this one as well under Maintenance Control's guidance. The panel regained function and the setup process proceeded normally afterwards. I verified steering was disengaged and also had the rampers disconnect the tow bar so I could turn on the hydraulic pumps and feel out the rudders. They felt normal again so I turned them off and we continued. We got our PAX/bag numbers in ACARS. All was good so we closed up and got pushed out. Started both engines and did the dual engine after start check. Rudders again felt normal. Got taxi clearance to follow Airline Y out to XXR and had full control authority over the rudders still. Cleared for takeoff which went well. Light wind down the runway; rudders fine. On climb out; can't remember exactly the altitude; maybe around 2;000 ft. MSL; FO remarked the pressurization looked abnormal. Cabin Altitude was already slowly climbing while our delta p was fairly normal. We were climbing at 200 KIAS until clear of the airspace then I started accelerating while climbing at a much lower VS. We climbed up to our cleared altitude of 5;000 ft. MSL at around 1;500 FPM (speeding up to 240 KIAS) and got cleared further to 10;000 ft. At approximately 6;000 ft. MSL; I noted a motor-like sound along with a yoke vibration and asked the FO if he could here/feel them. He stated he could. My best description of the yoke vibration would be similar to a handheld massager on a low setting. High frequency; small movements. The FO at some point around here called the FA to inquire about the cabin and any unusual noises or events. She stated there was a substantial amount of air leakage from both doors and a lot of noise. She even stated daylight was visible. He informed her to remain seated and buckled. I was initially considering a return to field around this point. Cabin Altitude was still climbing moderately faster than normal. I further slowed the climb rate to 1;000 FPM and remarked to the FO that we continue slowly climbing to see what the pressurization was going to do. Nearing 10;000 ft. we were cleared up to 15;000 ft. Still keeping a close watch on cabin altitude and delta p; we climbed further. Both rates were higher than normal; the Cabin Altitude was off more than the delta p. To my recollection; the cabin altitude never got above 4000-4;500 ft. I still was trying to gather more data to confirm or deny a return to field. We were still on our departure clearance heading and climbing to altitude. Not long after; FMS 1 went completely blank and was soon followed by a Pack 2 Overheat EICAS Message. At this point I stated we would return to the field and asked the FO to request a descent back to 10;000 ft. The FO informed Departure we would be returning; requested the lower altitude and immediately began preparing for the return. He got in the messages to ATC; dispatch; the FA (via NTSB-R) and finally the PAX. Cruise and descent checks were conducted somewhere around here as well. We got vectors to return to the field and the FO started loading the ILS XXR approach and getting runway numbers for our landing. We noted the takeoff weight on the departure brief and again upon the initial decision to return. At first call; I decided to return and prep for an immediate landing since I wasn't sure if more would go wrong. We were approximately 1;900 pounds too heavy for landing at this point. I initially deployed the speed brakes to slow down and also to burn more gas. Leveled at 10;000 ft. for a minute or two then I requested 7;000 ft. We slowed to 210 kts. and selected flaps 9 still with the brakes out. I had the FO run the overweight landing checklist in preparation for the landing. I felt we had positive control of the aircraft; the Cabin Altitude was acceptable and we still had all other screens functioning so I decided to continue burning fuel to get under max landing weight. FO stated ACARS was giving bad landing data so we reverted to the 145XR data cards for speeds at 45;000 pounds as we were still heavy. Runway distance required based on overweight landing was sufficient for XXR. I requested 5;000 ft. MSL at this point to aid in the Cabin Altitude and to stay well clear of all ground obstacles. We dropped the landing gear while stowing the speed brakes and still at flaps 9. We spent about 15 minutes burning gas in this configuration while being vectored by approach. Approximately 300 pounds over maximum weight I asked the FO to inform Tower we were ready to proceed inbound. We got vectors to final and cleared for the approach. Approach check was run also. We followed SOP for the ILS approach and were configured and stable on the approach. Reaching roughly 2;400 ft. MSL; I noticed the rudders became stiff (just as they had for the FO previously) and they required an excessive amount of force just for an inch or two of travel. I relaxed the rudder pressure mostly at this time. Again; the wind was pretty much straight down the runway and very light so we still had good directional control. I elected to continue to landing which went otherwise well. I previously briefed the FO that I'd stay slightly below the glide and still try to land like we were overweight. Once again; we were down Reverser 1 so brake pressure was heavier than normal and I elected to leave the Reverser 2 out longer. Rudders again actuated during tiller operation. Cabin Altitude upon landing jumped up to approximately 1;100 ft. MSL. During taxi back; the FO noted that the yaw damper was engaged which was odd because neither of us had selected it and the Autopilot was never engaged on any of our 2 legs. We had missed that with everything going on so I'm not sure when that activated. It was deselected and taxi in and parking proceeded as before. We had probably 7 or so people comment while deplaning and those were all positive. The ones I remember were were in this vein; thanks for getting us back here safe; thanks for making good decisions; appreciate you not forcing anything. While I know the passengers were frustrated; we didn't hear any negative feedback from them. I immediately called Dispatch and was passed along to the Duty Manager(I believe) who conferenced me in to a call with several Company Representatives. I related what all transpired to the best of my knowledge then was passed to Maintenance when they were satisfied. I spent the next couple hours on the phone with Maintenance trying to describe all this and properly enter it all into the logbooks. To rewind a bit; while being vectored I requested that ZZZ Maintenance be notified so there wouldn't be so much of a delay upon landing. He did have me run the packs for a bit to test of few things while I was on with Maintenance. He told me to kill the packs after a few minutes. After finishing with Maintenance; I think roughly 3-3.5 hours after the event; I called the Safety Rep back. I spent the next hour plus on the phone with him relating this experience as well. It was very apparent the plane wouldn't be able to go out that day after speaking with Maintenance; Dispatch and Scheduling. With this in mind; I tried to get the Crew to coordinate for a room and ride so they wouldn't have to wait for me. That process took quite a while and I left the aircraft with my Crew. Contract Maintenance was on board and on a call with Company Maintenance so I left it in his hands.We had semi-jokingly discussed refusing the plane upon seeing all the MELs and other stickers in the plane. End of a 4-day when you're more depleted than the first day was a tough pill in this scenario. It was a high workload due to the MELs and we briefed it. I wrongly assumed nothing else would go wrong on these 2 legs. Honoring the old adage about hindsight; I should have refused the plane. It was at a hub where Maintenance potentially could have been utilized to clear some of those items. I didn't ask clarifying questions such as why it wasn't worked on in ZZZ1 or if it was slated for work in ZZZ2. I should have. Priority handling was not declared; maybe I should have. I elected not to have crash; fire and rescue meet us. Maybe I should have. I felt we could still safely fly; land and taxi the aircraft so I deferred on those. Perhaps MELs should have a heavier look so that so many compounding/aggravating MELs aren't present on a single plane like this. I feel this could be a great candidate for our new sessions in future.",,,,"EMB-145 Captain reported stiffness in the Rudder Pedals during preflight.

The METAR at the time our deicing process began read 06011KT 1/4SM R03R/1800V2400FT +SN FG VV004 01/M01 A2957. Type I fluid was applied to deice; followed by Type IV to anti-ice. The fluid was Clariant Safewing MP IV Launch at 100% concentration. During taxi from our gate to the deice pad; the FO and I noted the severity of the snow storm in progress. While taxiing from XX approaching XY; we experienced NIL braking action; wherein I had fully applied both brakes and was seeing no deceleration; requiring the deployment of both thrust reverser's in order to stop the aircraft. Eventually we made it to the deice pad. During deicing; we observed and notified the crew of an A321 that had just finished deicing that they appeared to have a Type IV fluid failure; with snow accumulation covering the portion of its right wing to the left of the engine mount. That crew appreciated our report and returned to the pad for a second round of deicing. Once our deice crew had applied our Type IV fluid; we ran our post-procedure checklist and proceeded a short distance from our deice pad assignment to a nearby taxiway; where the A321 had been sitting earlier; which paralleled our departure runway. We were in line behind another Regional Jet which had just completed deicing as well; and we could already see that this aircraft's Type IV fluid had failed. Snow had already accumulated on both of its flaps and winglets. The FO (First Officer) and I had already briefed that we would conduct an inspection of the Type IV fluid from the cabin prior to takeoff. Rather than wait until we were closer to taking off; we elected to conduct the inspection earlier than normal; due to the evidence of widespread Type IV fluid failure with other aircraft. While my FO was in the cabin; I took a look at our left wing from my vantage point in the flight deck; and observed that the Type IV green dye had already dissipated substantially; with snow beginning to accumulate in those areas. Not surprisingly; my FO returned about 3 minutes later; advising me that it was evident the Type IV fluid had already failed on both wings; and especially on the right wing; where snow was now blanketing the entire surface. During that time; the Regional Jet in front of us had advised Ground Control of the same. Eventually; the A321; the Regional Jet we were behind; and us all returned to our gates; citing a Type IV fluid failure as the cause. Numerous other aircraft from other deicing pads stated the same.The cause of this event is heavy snow overcoming the protective qualities of Type IV anti-icing fluid. Given the time frame between the start time of the anti-icing fluid application and the observed failure of that fluid; I do not have any confidence in our Flight Operations Manual's assertion that our aircraft may safely depart in heavy snow. While the manual requires a pre-takeoff check; after this experience; I believe we should err on the side of caution and further study when dispatching in heavy snow is reasonable. I do not believe doing so when the temperature is hovering just above freezing is advisable; as the snow appeared to have a water content that easily and quickly defeated the Type IV fluid.This event will recur given the same weather conditions; absent a change in dispatch procedures during heavy snow events; or a change in a more resilient fluid for use in heavy snow conditions.",,,,"CRJ-900 Captain reported an apparent failure of the Type 1 and Type 4 deice and anti-icing fluids that had been applied to the aircraft during a heavy snowstorm pre-departure.

Upon completing the turn into the right downwind; the engine (Rotax 912ULS) sputtered; then died completely. I quickly requested priority; then established best glide speed at 55 kts. Since I had just begun the downwind leg; I quickly judged that if I was to glide straight ahead; I might be too low to be able to successfully turn 180 degrees and land on Runway XX. So; instead; I turned to the right 90 degrees; added 10 degrees of flaps; flew a base leg; and then turned left towards Runway XY. I was high; and I knew I would have a tailwind of about 10-14 kts (straight down the runway); so I added 10 more degrees of flaps (20 is max) and slipped the plane to lose altitude; heading straight for the Runway 'XY' numbers; maintaining 55 kts. When I was low enough; I released the slip and flew straight into a downwind landing. The landing was very smooth; though a bit fast as expected. I used the brakes to slow down; and turned at the first available taxiway. My momentum carried me across the runway threshold; where I announced over UNICOM that my landing was successful; that neither I nor the plane were damaged; and that the active runway was clear.Sitting on the taxiway; I quickly discovered that both fuel valves were in the 'off' (horizontal) position. I remembered that just previous to my last touch and go; I had noticed that the right tank fuel level was significantly lower than the left tank; and so I shut off the fuel to the right tank hoping to equalize the levels. Before doing so; I did not check the position of the left tank valve lever; which is located right behind the pilot's left shoulder; and takes some effort to see or feel. I assumed it was open when I closed the right tank valve; but actually; it was closed. The engine dying was my fault; I had starved the engine of fuel. Upon opening the fuel valves; the engine started immediately and ran normally.",,,,"Ultralight aircraft pilot reported engine failure in downwind leg of traffic pattern.

SLC TRACON was talking to Aircraft Y when they were within near midair collision standards and I advised SLC TRACON afterward that I had to make an evasive maneuver to avoid Aircraft Y. I think what caused the incident was that SLC TRACON was busy and Aircraft Y was relying on them for traffic advisories and was not scanning ADS-B or the air for other aircraft as they did not attempt to make any maneuvers to avoid me. I think what should have been done is that SLC TRACON should have given that traffic alert when it was relevant and they were very busy; but they still should have given the alert and Aircraft Y should have still been scanning the air; ADSB-B; ForeFlight; etc. for other traffic.",,,,"Pilot reported NMAC with another aircraft while in cruise flight.",

The next day the same thing happened and we asked for vectors again on the arrival to ZZZ.

I quickly corrected around 9;400 ft. and immediately slowed to 250 or below. Before we got a left turn; the controller informed us the MVA was 9;000 ft. and he cleared us to 8;000 ft. At that point we became very uncomfortable. Also; the controller told us we could climb back to 9;000 ft. if we wanted to; which I didn't feel necessary since we got a left turn. The controller never specifically told us to climb and maintain 9;000 ft. He asked us if we had climbed to 9;000 ft. after we had turned; which I found odd. He then informed us that 'now you're in the way of some other traffic.' We landed uneventfully and never got a GPWS terrain caution.I believe the jamming of the GPS signals set this in motion; I don't know if it was because of [the event] or not.

The TRP (Takeoff Runway Performance) was considered inoperative and an auto-throttle off takeoff (non-profile) was briefed as per the MEL procedures. The Engine Pressure Ratio bugs were set to manual as reference only knowing the engines were in N1 mode for the entire flight. Upon taking the Runway for takeoff; I pushed the power up to 40% N1; selected TOGA and stated 'set thrust'. I initially pushed up the thrust but allowed the First Officer set takeoff thrust; as briefed. As we began to well into our acceleration; I noticed that the First Officer did not call 'thrust set' as well as no '80 kts.' call. This prompted me to look at his throttle adjustment for takeoff and I observed him closely looking at the engine instruments and pushing up the #1 throttle stating '#1 doesn't look right'. I quickly looked at the throttles and pushed the #1 engine forward further and did not notice; what should have been a power increase and the First Officer stated '#1 is lagging'. My view of the engine instruments was at a glance; at best; knowing we were accelerating and I was the pilot flying maintaining aircraft control on the Runway. What I did observe initially was the noticeable split in Engine Pressure Ratios because that was at the top of the engine instruments and I did not observe a noticeable movement in any of the other instruments (N1; EGT; etc) nor feel any engine acceleration due to the throttle being pushed forward. To note; all of the above happened in a matter of seconds. Without further delay; I rejected the aircraft around 110 kts. as there was doubt as well as little confidence that the #1 engine was at takeoff thrust due to First Officer verbal cues along with his adjustment of pushing up #1 throttle beyond where the #2 throttle was set (split throttles). For safety of flight and my concern for the aircraft's ability to get airborne with two engines running at the correct thrust a Rotation was accomplished uneventfully. We then discussed with ZZZ and ZZZ1 a plan to return to the Gate. Also to note; on debrief of the event I queried the First Officer as to what he was referring to when he was adjusting the #1 throttle along with the statements '#1 doesn't look right' and '#1 was lagging' and stated he initially did see the Engine Pressure Ratio split but referenced the N1; N2; EGT; etc for the throttle discrepancy and lack of response. Because there was no confidence in takeoff thrust being set properly on the #1 engine along with a lack of callouts assuring takeoff thrust was correct for the #1 engine by the First Officer by making the statements '#1 doesn't look right' and '#1 is lagging' a decision was made to make a rejected takeoff. With a doubt in safety of flight; the Rotation was accomplished uneventfully. With the statements by the First Officer and the lack confidence in the takeoff thrust being set for the #1 engine; I don't think there is a prevention. The only option with those factors as stated above; with a doubt in the aircraft's thrust setting; would lead to a rejected Takeoff.",,,,"A300 Captain reported communications issues during take off with FADEC MEL that required the Engines to be in N1 Mode.

The crew performed the checklist which required no items to be performed and advised that the Fluid Quantity in the Main Hydraulic Side of the Reservoir was Low. Several moments later; the EICAS System alerted the crew with a Master Caution and Amber Crew Alert System (CAS) Message 'AUX HYD QTY LO' Message; in which the crew immediately performed the actions specified in the QRH. While running the QRH for the 'AUX HYD QTY LOW'; pressure in the Main Hydraulic System began to drop rapidly generating a subsequent Master Caution Alert with associated Amber 'MAIN HYD PRESS' Message. Determining that the aircraft was in a state of complete Hydraulic Failure; the crew [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center and advised of intentions to divert to ZZZZ1 to perform an immediate landing on their longest runway (Runway X).Being too heavy too land as the aircraft had just departed ZZZZ and lacks capability to jettison fuel; the crew requested holding instructions in order to burn off fuel and complete all of the appropriate QRH Checklist items prior to attempting the urgent landing. ZZZZ Center issued holding instructions north of the ZZZZZ Intersection at 10000 ft. While in holding; the crew was made aware that Runway X was wet from a passing rain shower; in which the crew elected to remain in holding until confirmation of a dry runway prior to attempting the landing in order to solicit the most successful outcome. Additionally; while in holding; the crew was able to successfully lower the landing gear using the alternate free-fall procedure in the QRH but was unsuccessful in lowering the flaps; requiring the landing to be zero flap. Having completed all checklists the crew briefed the landing procedure that would be performed zero flap; with Inoperative Spoilers; Thrust Reversers and Normal Barking as well as use of the Emergency Braking System. The flight crew additionally briefed the medical crew and passengers of the nature of the situation and what commands and instructions to expect upon landing.After confirmation that Runway X was dry; the crew departed holding and performed the ILS X approach to a successful and safe landing on Runway X. Once the aircraft came to a complete stop; the crew notified ATC that the aircraft would be disabled on the runway and will require a tow to the FBO. Moments later; the Fire Department inspected the aircraft on the runway and observed no damage nor any blown tires and that the aircraft was safe to tow off the runway. During this time; the crew determined that there was no need for evacuation and elected to keep everyone onboard the aircraft until it was safely towed to the FBO. Once parked at the FBO; both crew members performed a post flight inspection of the aircraft and determined there was no damage. Additionally; no injuries were incurred during the course of the event. The Dispatch Team; Director of Maintenance and Director of Operations were all immediately notified of the Urgent Landing and debriefed. Finally; the appropriate write up was entered into the aircraft's maintenance log and submitted for review and correction by the Maintenance Team.",,"After departure from ZZZZ and leveling off at 38000 ft; a White MAIN HYD QTY LO Message appeared on the EICAS. I then looked up the QRH and ran the checklist which required no items to be done; and only advised that the Main Quantity was Low. Two to three minutes later we got a Master Caution and an Amber Crew Alert System (CAS) Message AUX HYD QTY LO. I then used the QRH checklist and performed the actions specified. While running the QRH checklist for the AUX HYD QTY LOW; the Left Main Hydraulic System began to steadily lose pressure giving a Master Caution Alert and Amber MAIN HYD PRESS Message. We verified that we were having a Hydraulic System Failure with both the Main and Aux system. We [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center; and advised them we wanted to make an urgent landing at ZZZZ1 using Runway X. We requested holding instructions in order to burn off fuel and to complete all of the QRH Checklist items prior to attempting the urgent landing. ZZZZ Center issued holding instructions at ZZZZZ intersection at 10000 ft. While in holding; ZZZZ notified that Runway X was currently wet from a rain shower. We discussed our options and decided to remain in holding until confirmation of a dry runway prior to attempting to land in order to have the best landing conditions. This also allowed more fuel to be burned which allowed us to have a slower approach speed; and the ability to stop quicker. Using the QRH check list we lowered the gear by the free fall method; but was unsuccessful in lowering the flaps; requiring the landing to be zero flap landing. Having completed all checklists; we briefed the landing procedure that we would be performing; a zero Flap; no Spoilers; no thrust reversers; and would use the emergency braking system. The Medical Crew and passengers were briefed on the situation and urgent landing.After confirmation that Runway X was dry; we departed the hold and asked for vectors for the ILS X approach. A safe landing was performed on Runway X. Once the aircraft came to a complete stop; we notified ATC that the aircraft was disabled on the runway and will require a tow to the FBO.

I performed the check and also noticed the stiffness; but there was no restriction or problem with movement. We discussed our options and I decided since there was no binding or restricted movement; we should be good to continue. On departure at 800 ft. AGL; the FO performed the thrust cutback as per the noise abatement procedure. When I went to lower the pitch; the yoke felt stuck. It took an unusual amount of force to free the yoke and lower the nose. We leveled off at 13;000 ft. and ran the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls QRH. Upon completion of the QRH; we decided it was best to divert to ZZZ1. I coordinated with Dispatch and told him our problem and the plan to divert to ZZZ1; and he agreed that was the best course of action. The FO coordinated our divert with Approach. We did not [request priority handling] as the aircraft was flying normally. I briefed the Flight Attendants and Passengers and called ZZZ1 Station Operations to ensure they were in the loop. The FO calculated the landing data and we realized we would have to make an overweight landing; as we weighed 133;500 pounds. He referenced the overweight landing section in the manual and we decided to land on XXR at ZZZ1 since it was the longest runway. We looked at brake cooling but it was not a factor. We configured normally; landed and taxied to the gate without incident. All in all; this was a fairly straightforward diversion; but after pulling into the gate; coordinating with Maintenance; Dispatch; Company Operations Chief Pilot; and Crew Scheduling; and making the appropriate write-ups; I found myself drained. I was very grateful we did not have to continue with our flying and instead got to deadhead home.",,"On takeoff; as the Captain lowered the nose to accelerate; he experienced a very brief 'hanging up' in the elevator controls. It was easily overpowered and the decision to make a precautionary overweight landing in ZZZ1 was made. During the previous landing I noticed a very slight roughness in the elevator during flare; but it was not a feeling that was out of the ordinary enough to cause concern of a potential malfunction. During the Flight Control Check; there was a slight roughness in the elevator; but again it didn't seem anything more than what would be experienced during normal operations. It was very subtle and noted by both of us as being within normal limits from past experience. I noticed the 'hang up' that the Captain experienced on takeoff and it had amplified enough to cause us both concern and initiate a divert.",,"B737 flight crew reported after takeoff the elevator control system felt stiff.

Upon making my descent on base; I received a terrain warning and a gear proxy alert as I was commanding the gear be dropped. I continued visually on the approach and made a safe landing. Upon further retrospection; I could have held my descent another 15 seconds; but I had evaluated that I was clear of the terrain; upon my descent. On the other hand the EGPWS system momentarily disagreed with this as the gear was not down yet. I have read the company policy upon visual arrivals into ZZZ and; I fully agree with this approach though I was complying with it at the time. I do believe that holding the descent another 15 to 30 seconds would have made a difference and this would not have been an event.

I initially thought he would continue straight (opposite to our taxi direction) as we were already close to the ramp road lane that crosses the ramp at point 'V;' however instead he turned right (now heading north) in the ramp lane that crosses at point 'V' - thus turning to cross in front of my aircraft. I assumed seeing the aircraft he would stop; but instead the driver shifted his eyes to look towards the cockpit; and then instead of stopping the tug quickly accelerated across the lane. Due to the close proximity of the tug; I was forced to aggressively apply brakes to avoid collision. Though the flight attendants were still moving in the cabin; none were injured. After stopping the aircraft I notified Ramp Control about the incursion and asked them to review ramp camera tapes to if the tug could be identified. Ramp indicated they would try to trace it down.Driver turned toward a moving aircraft that was already too close to the crossing lane. Then; after briefly shifting eyes up toward the cockpit; accelerated across the lane instead of stopping.

Completed the ECAM procedures; checked for follow up in QRH; contacted dispatch/maintenance to discuss best course of action. I decided that a divert to ZZZ was required. Aircraft would have only single reverser; 40% of ground spoilers would not work; and nose wheel steering would be inoperative after landing. I chose ZZZ because it has long runways; and I knew my landing distance would be affected by the failures. The diversion was made; the landing was completed. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was on scene and looked over the aircraft. We were then hooked to a super tug to be towed to the gate. While crossing the boundary from Ground Control to Ramp Control; the escort vehicle leading the tug stopped at the ramp entrance; and the tug carrying the aircraft was unable to stop and hit the escort vehicle. No damage was noted by me; and I believe the collision speed was less than 1 mph. Upon arrival at the gate the Aircraft Maintenance Logbook (AML) was filled out for the yellow hydraulic failure; and the collision with the ground vehicle. Approximately one minute after I received an ECAM for the low hydraulic level; the flight attendant called me to notify me that we had a passenger that was having an 'anxiety attack'. There was weather in the ZZZ1 area and we had light to moderate turbulence for approximately 40 minutes during the climbout. This was also my First Officer's first trip off OE as a new hire pilot. Several causal factors played a role in the event. 1) Widespread convective activity in the ZZZ1 area gave us a pretty rough ride; which was concerning enough for at least one passenger to become distressed. This did not have any relevance to the rest of the event except that it was distracting to deal with during the course of the event. 2) New hire FO. This trip was the First Officer's first trip off OE at Airline X. The event occurred on the third leg of the trip. He is an experienced pilot from Airline Y and did a fantastic job. 3) Dispatch/Maintenance. In making my decision to divert to ZZZ; I contacted dispatch and Maintenance Control to confer about the issues. Dispatch told me that operationally; they would've preferred the aircraft to be in ZZZ2. I decided to divert to ZZZ because I could not justify flying for another two hours; and then [request priority handling] because of the landing distance issues. 4) After landing process. I had let Dispatch and Maintenance know the nature of the [problem]; and that we would need to be towed off of the runway to the gate. After ARFF looked over the aircraft; Maintenance showed up in a pick up truck with gear pins and were told that they just needed to pin the gear and I would taxi to the gate. I informed them that I had no nose wheel steering and I would have to be towed with a tug. The whole event from landing; to getting a tug; to removal from the runway took approximately 20 to 30 minutes because the tug was not waiting for us when we landed. This tied up the runway in ZZZ while they were doing instrument approaches. To me it just seemed like there wasn't adequate coordination done before we got there.I don't believe that there is anything that could've been done to resolve the hydraulic issue; but I do have some observations about things that may be would've been helpful. 1) I've been involved with two [priority handling requests] in the last six months and it doesn't seem to me that Dispatch is much of a resource. I generally have the expectation that I'm calling them to help me with my issue; but I think that I've learned that I need to have a course of action decided and just tell them what I'm going to do. 2) When we arrived at the gate; there was a slew of people in the jetway to meet us; the ARFF event commander; in-flight coordinator; etc. I never got a chance to talk to the tug driver because he had unplugged and driven off and was gone to his next assignment before I got a chance to thank him or discuss the event. The collision was not his fault; and I wanted to let him know that but to also let him know that it had to go in the AML. 3) The Flight Attendants were gone before I ever got a chance to thank them or debrief them. They elected not to continue with their trip and went home; I think in the future I will make sure that I get the opportunity to debrief everybody; but I was so busy talking to ARFF; mechanics; etc. that I never got the chance. 4) I have decided that in the future; if I have to [request priority handling]; once we land; the trip will be over for me. I agreed to swap aircraft and fly the remainder of the flight and passengers to ZZZ2; because crew scheduling told us that once we got to ZZZ2; we would be done and could go to the hotel for the night. Enroute; they reassigned us to an additional leg after we got to ZZZ2. I was to deadhead on the flight to ZZZ; and my First Officer was to fly it. This makes for a very exhausting day when the first leg was a [priority handling event] and erodes the safety margin. The First Officer told me that at Airline Y; it is policy that if you [request priority handling] you are done and are removed from the rest of the trip. Being a new hire on his first trip with Airline X; he didn't have the choice not to do the leg. I will not allow that to happen again.",,,,"Air carrier flight crew reported hydraulic system malfunction in cruise flight.",

The vehicle continued into the open area at the west end of C Concourse; where lots of ground equipment is stored.

During climb out the Relief Pilot First Officer and I proceeded to start our first rest break for the leg to ZZZZ. We were both in our respective bunks when the Flying Captain called me to inform me that they needed both me and the First Officer to the flight deck as that we have a spoiler problem and that we were returning to ZZZ. We both returned to the flight deck and were informed that the number 10 spoiler had popped up and was causing drag on the aircraft. I was also told that the flying crew had discussed the situation with the company and it was determined that the flight cannot continue on its planned flight to ZZZZ and should return to ZZZ since that was the nearest airport.I immediately asked if we were dumping fuel. I was informed that we were not and that is was not planned to dump fuel and we were going to do an overweight landing. This was determined by the flying crew; and the Company I believe; since it was actually safe to do this and it would take a lot of time to dump fuel and since we had a flight control issue; we needed to land at the nearest safe airport. There was concern that there might be more degradation in the control of the aircraft and we wanted to land as soon as possible. The Relief Pilot First Officer (FO) and; with the help of the flying FO; determined if we had enough runway to safely land the aircraft at ZZZ with our spoiler control issue. It was determined that we did. We also determined that we had the performance to safely go around if needed at our weight since we were landing over weight. We determined that we did have the required performance. Even though we did have the required performance for both landing and a go-around; I suggested to the flying Captain that we should consider dumping fuel to lower our weight as much as possible since it would only make it safer. The flying Captain once again thought it would take too much time and they wanted to land as soon as possible considering our flight control issue. We obtained our clearance from ZZZ Center and proceeded to the intersection and then to ZZZZZ intersection for the ZZZZZ arrival and the ILS to XXL. We briefed the approach and landing; completed all checklist including the overweight landing checklist and made an approach and landing to Runway XXL at ZZZ airport. We then taxied to the gate and parked. During the debrief I mentioned that; although the flying Captain flew a very safe approach and landing considering the weight of the aircraft; I was uncomfortable with the weight we landed at because our Vref and target speeds were very high and very close to flap over-speed and to Vmin. I said that this is why I believed that we should have tried to dump as much fuel as possible while we were waiting for a clearance back to ZZZ as that we could have lowered our weight enough to obtain a lower Vref and Vmin speed for a safer approach and landing.

As we were beginning our left turn; I noticed that the right window was filled with an aircraft. Almost immediately the 'DESCEND NOW' command came into my headset; along with the warning box. The aural alert sounded at least twice; and my immediate thought was that a command to descend when I was only at 450-500 AGL was unusual; to say the least. However; I pushed the nose down firmly but not aggressively to silence the warning. Our total descent/altitude loss was probably in the range of 50-100 ft. When we were clear of the conflict; we continued our climb; and the First Officer (FO); as pilot monitoring; reported the RA to the Tower. Aircraft Y also reported an RA to the Tower. I have no idea what might have triggered this. The winds were gusty; but only 2 degrees off the center line of the runway. But I have never had a 'DESCEND NOW' command so close to the ground.

We were on a left downwind vector from Approach Control at 3000 ft. MSL and in beautiful; day VMC conditions. Abeam the airport; Approach Control asked and we reported the airport in sight. They then cleared us for a visual approach. The FO stated they were going to continue the downwind and set the altitude at 2200 ft. (FAF altitude for the previously briefed GPS approach). At this time; I noticed 2 other aircraft on the TCAS that appeared to be about 10 miles out; one of which was within a few hundred feet of our altitude and possibly also inbound to the airport. Approach had not notified us of any other traffic. We leveled off; traffic was now 7-8 miles away but still not in sight. Shortly after leveling Approach Control issued a low altitude alert for us. At this time I noticed 2 antennas below and to our left approximately 1 mile. Within a couple seconds of this; our Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) issued an Obstacle Caution; quickly followed by a Pull Up. We immediately climbed; and within a few seconds the alert silenced. We then re-established our visual approach and landed uneventfully. On our debrief; we identified the obstacles/antenna that set the EGPWS alert off. They were approximately 350 ft. below our altitude. Descending on a visual approach clearance too soon from a known safe vectoring altitude; to an altitude that was not sufficiently above all obstacles to not trigger the EGPWS alerts. Complacency from the weather being beautiful day; VMC conditions was a contributing factor. Distraction from a potential traffic conflict was also a contributing factor. During our debrief; we talked about simply maintaining the last assigned vectoring altitude; or MSA until established on the instrument approach that the visual approach is being backed up with; as we do for night visual approaches. This is actually what I have told many FOs to do many times in the past when cleared for a visual approach. This particular time though; I believe a few factors contributed to unintentionally not following this personal policy. I was distracted by the potential traffic conflict ahead (I've had to go around at this airport before for traffic); and was complacent in not being vigilant to first focus on the priority of our aircraft position. Also; the weather was beautiful; day VMC and visibility was great contributing to complacency. Additionally; this actually made the antennas less visible than they would've been at night with flashing lights. In the future; a briefing on what obstacles on the downwind could potentially be an issue should we subsequently be cleared for a visual approach. Bottom line though; is simply maintaining that last assigned vectored altitude from Approach Control; or the MSA until established on the IAP that the visual approach is being backed up with would have prevented this.",,"While coming in to the airport and abeam it on the left downwind we were cleared by Tower for the visual approach to Runway XX; at the time we were at 3000 ft. and had put the RNAV for XX into the box and were using it for guidance for the visual approach as the ILS was Out of Service (OTS). I was the pilot flying and Captain was the pilot monitoring. At the time we were monitoring two aircraft that were near the final approach course and near our lower altitude that may be going into the airport. Looking to stay ahead of the aircraft I descended down to 2200 which was the FAF altitude to then start setting up so we could get an accurate vertical descent rate while the Captain looked for traffic still. Upon reaching 2200 we got a call from Tower giving us a low altitude alert. Just after the Captain noticed two towers off to our right that seemed close and then right after we got the obstacle oral warning and pull up so I disengaged the autopilot and added the thrust required and we climbed back up to clear the threat and once stabilized and level continued on the visual approach and landed without further incidence. Based off looking at the info on the ground about the tower height we were never any lower than 350-400 ft. above the obstacle and had further clearance as we never flew directly over either tower. The cause of the event was the early descent on the visual approach below the last safe altitude that was assigned by ATC before getting onto a published portion of the course where we would know we are safe from obstacles. Complacency was definitely a factor as well as we had briefed the highest obstacle which was to the north but did not look into ones to the south where we were coming from for the approach. Some suggestions for helping to avoid this from recurring are to ensure not to descend below the last assigned altitude from ATC on a visual unless we are closer to the final approach segment and can descend to a lower altitude and can ensure obstacle clearance. Additionally making sure to brief relevant tall obstacles especially when a visual approach is expected. Lastly practicing more visual approaches in training I really feel would be useful especially ones when using RNAV for guidance as it is very unusual and not always the most comfortable flying them.",,"CRJ 900 flight crew reported Low Altitude Alert from ATC and a EGPWS Alert on approach.",

As we were getting vectored I could tell that we were getting vectored behind a few preceding aircraft. ATC slowed us to 210 knots and continued to vector us. We encountered some light wake turbulence but nothing drastic. I was watching the TCAS and could see we were following an aircraft. As we continued to follow; ATC slowed us to 180 knots and I called flaps 8. About 10 seconds later I could see and feel the plane sway. I gripped the yoke in preparation. And sure enough we hit strong wake turbulence. I instinctively clicked off the autopilot as the plane began an uncommanded roll to the right. I fought it back to level only for another uncommanded roll to the left to happen. There was about 4 uncommanded rolls with the greatest bank angle nearing 40 degrees. I was able to keep altitude loss to about 120 to 150 feet and airspeed did fluctuate a good amount. We got clear and I reported it to ATC. It was a 747 about 7-10 miles in front of us that caused it. The rest of the approach and landing was uneventful. The cause was not enough separation between us and the 747 to allow for wake to dissipate.

The procedure is confusing because it says to fly southeast on the R-299. Radials are typically flown outbound away from the station. It did not say to fly the R-119 southeast.There were no headings or MCA given in the departure description to provide guidance to comply with the instructions for a departure on either Runway 06 or Runway 24. Normally; because obstacle departures are keeping the aircraft clear of obstacles; the departure instructions are very explicit with climb rates per mile; headings; DMEs; and altitudes to reach prior to any turns. In the absence of those instructions I proceeded outbound on the R-299. To avoid confusion in the future; consideration should be given to rewriting the ODP (Obstacle Departure Procedures). One possible alternative would be to state:'Departing Runway 24 fly runway heading until XXX ft then turn right or left to intercept the R-199 southeast and climb to XXX ft.' 'Departing Runway 6 fly runway heading until XXX ft then turn right to intercept the R-199 southeast and climb to XXX ft.'If minimum climb rates are required they should be included in the departure description.",,,,"Corporate jet Captain reported the Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) at WJF airport are confusing and non-standard and do not include necessary performance requirements to avoid terrain and obstructions.",

This was an originating flight. I performed a pre-flight inspection and did not see any abnormalities. We pushed back normally and taxied out on Engine #2 to Runway XL for departure. On taxi out; we started the #1 engine. Start occurred normally. Three to five minutes later; we were cleared into position on Runway XL. We took the runway. Tower cleared us for take-off. The Captain set the thrust to 40% N1; and then applied normal take-off power. Immediately we heard Tower key up the mic and told us to abort the take-off. A (other carrier) aircraft had apparently observed a 10 ft. flame out the back of the #1 engine; and the Tower informed us of this immediately. The Captain called the abort; closed the thrust levers; extended the speed brakes; applied the brakes; and deployed reverse thrust.I made the appropriate call outs. We had not yet achieved 80 kts; as I had not made the 80-kt. call. We stopped the aircraft just prior to the taxiway. Tower called for Crash Fire and Rescue trucks to be rolled. The Captain made the appropriate 'Remain Seated' call over the PA; and then quickly contacted the Flight Attendants to inform them of the rejected takeoff; asked if they saw any smoke or flames in the #1 engine; and to remain seated and standby. We had no indication of fire from flight deck indications. Correctly; in my estimation; the Captain then called for the Tail Pipe Fire QRH. We ran the Checklist methodically; shutting down the engine and proceeded with motoring it per the QRH. By this time; Crash Fire and Rescue had reached the aircraft.We made contact with (CFR) Crash Fire Rescue and they determined that there was no active fire or smoke coming from the #1 Engine. We ran the brake cooling performance data module and determined that our brake energy was low enough to indicate parking at the gate was safe; should we decide to continue back to the gate. We communicated with CFR that we would like an escort back to the terminal. We informed Station Operations that we had a rejected takeoff and a tailpipe fire and that we needed to return to the gate. The Captain communicated with the Flight Attendants and the passengers that we were instructed by Tower to make a rejected takeoff; and that we needed to return to the gate for maintenance. We then started the APU; performed the after landing flow; and taxied back to the gate under the Supervision of CFR.Upon arrival at gate; CFR inspected the #1 engine and found no indication of smoke or fire. We deplaned the aircraft normally through the main cabin door. We then had a face-to-face meeting with the Fire Chief to discuss their response to the situation and both sides agreed that CFR handled the situation with speed; good communication; and an emphasis on safety. They are to be commended. I was personally impressed by both the timeliness of their response; and their willingness to seek feedback after the event. Kudos to the Captain for calling for the proper checklists and bringing the aircraft to a stop safely; early in the takeoff. Also; commendations to the Flight Attendants for keeping the cabin calm; while we handled things on the flight deck. Maintenance arrived and we discussed the event; putting the write up for the #1 engine as a reported tailpipe fire. I am satisfied that we handled the matter in accordance with the training I have received as a Company First Officer.",,"Number 1 Engine had tailpipe fire on takeoff. Other Air Carrier saw 10 ft. flames coming from the #1 Engine during takeoff roll and reported to Tower. ATC then requested us to reject the takeoff. Reject occurred at 75 kts.

While enroute we noticed that the Left Engine Oil Quantity was decreasing. I started to write down the UTC time every time that the Quantity decreased by one quart. The rate of decrease seemed excessive so we relayed this information to Maintenance and Dispatch. Shortly thereafter we were contacted by the Dispatcher via SATCOM and they advised us that after consulting with Maintenance and Operations that they were recommending that we change our destination to ZZZ in order to shorten the duration of the flight. We requested and received an amended clearance that was essentially a direct route to ZZZ. We reviewed the Diversion planning in the Flight Manual and we reviewed the Flight Manual checklists that we thought we might need later in the flight. We also reviewed the Procedures Manual. The flying pilots took over the flying positions about an hour outside of ZZZ. Priority handling was requested and the flying pilots decided to use a high speed descent to the airport.

The aircraft had several write ups from the previous crew; which were cleared by Maintenance in ZZZ. One of the write ups included an ADR (Air Data Reference) deferral. At the start of the take-off roll on Runway X in ZZZ; the Thrust Levers were placed in the detent. Upon placement; the thrust came up normally and when it reached the target Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR); an AUTO FLT A/THR OFF ECAM was presented. In addition; the Captain's Speed Scale turned completely Red. This all occurred almost simultaneously in the low speed regime around 80 kts. The Captain initiated a rejected take-off. The proper procedure was followed and we came to a stop on the runway. Upon completion of the QRC; we taxied off and the after landing flow was accomplished. While troubleshooting with Maintenance Control; there was a Brakes Hot ECAM; therefore Engine 2 was shut down. A return to gate was accomplished and Dispatch was notified of the rejected take-off. After gate arrival; we deplaned; had a crew debrief; and spoke with a ZZZ Flight Manager; who filled in the Chief Pilot.",,"The event Aircraft was Nose X. The airplane came in from ZZZ1 and the inbound crew encountered an Auto Flight malfunction of the Auto Thrust on climb out. They were able to get it restored but wrote it up. Maintenance was on the airplane when we got there and were running checks and were unable to find anything so after talking it over with my First Officer; we arrived at the conclusion that we were good to take the plane. We briefed threats that we were facing as part of my departure brief; I even included that we might see and Auto Flight ECAM as I briefed the Rejected Take-off (RTO). I briefed per SOP not only what we reject for relative to speed regime but also what I was going to do accordingly and how we were to act as a crew. Taxi out was uneventful and we were instructed to line up and wait on Runway X. Upon receiving our take-off clearance I asked my First Officer if they were ready and they replied that they were. I advanced the thrust levers to around 1.05 Engine Pressure Ratio (EPR); waited to make sure the engines were stabilized before advancing smoothly to the Detent. I checked my Primary Flight Display (PFD) for my FMA (Flight Mode Annunicator) changes before calling 'Check Thrust.' As I finished the call out; out of the corner of my eye I noticed the entire speed tape on my PFD become a Red Brick momentarily then return. Shortly thereafter as we were accelerating rapidly through in my estimate 70 kts; we got the Chime; Caution Light and ECAM for an Auto Flight Auto Thrust malfunction. As we were in the low speed regime and I had briefed that we would reject for anything below 100 kts; I called the reject and retarded the thrust levers. We were barely above 80 kts. so I only managed to get the thrust levers back to forward idle and the Auto Brakes kicked in decelerating rapidly. I kicked off the brakes and brought us to a stop straight ahead on the runway center line. The First Officer carried out their tasks perfectly and we then jumped into the rejected take-off checklist. After completing that; I called both front and rear galleys to verify that everyone was safe; seated and that we could move the aircraft. With that squared away we taxied clear; contacted the Company and initiated a gate return.",,"A319 flight crew reported an Auto Throttle Fail ECAM Message during take-off roll.

We were level at FL250. We were having a discussion about contacting the Company about this indication. We were then cleared up to FL310 and initiated the climb. In the climb we noticed the vibrations decreased to ~2 and we decided to see what they did when we leveled at FL310. Around 25;500 ft.; we received a Fire Warning Bell with no EICAS associated. We then checked the overhead panel and saw the Main Deck Fire Illuminated. The associated EICAS was eventually displayed. Person A contacted ATC and stopped the climb at FL260. Person B (3rd seat) got the QRH out and prepared to run the checklist. Person A took over as pilot flying (PF) while I switched to pilot monitoring (PM). Person A [requested priority handling] and asked for an initial vector for a return to ZZZZ. Person A alerted Person C; who came up and was informed of what was going on. Person B started to run the checklist so we donned oxygen masks and made sure we had communication with each other and ATC. We initially stayed at FL260 or descended to FL250; I do not recall. We checked the Environmental Control System (ECS) synoptic to check temperatures but we did not have any indication of high temperature. We also had no smoke in the cockpit. Once we were closer to ZZZZ we descended and extended flaps to 10 and gear in an attempt to burn more fuel. On the descent we had multiple more EICAS Messages and Fire Bells alerting Main Deck Fire. Temps on ECS synoptic stayed the same. We also received ELEC GEN 1 EICAS on descent; which was reset. We prepared for a landing on XXL. Person B ran numbers and referenced QRH for overweight VREF speeds; which matched Flight Duty numbers. Per the QRH we used auto-brakes max. I was communicating with ATC and informed them we would like the fire crew to assess the heat in the cargo hold and to not approach the gear due to overheating brakes. We made an overweight landing on XXL and came to a stop on the runway. Trucks approached us on the runway and it seemed they were hosing the gear with water to cool the brakes. We still had communications with Tower but not the fire crew. Eventually the fire crew boarded the aircraft and checked the entire main deck and upper deck for heat and or fire. We were then towed off the runway. We had conversations with ATC before we were released off the aircraft. Possible cause was the amount of rain water on and around all the cargo on the main deck. It was raining heavily during our time on the ground in ZZZZ for unloading and reloading of the aircraft.",,"We landed ZZZZ1-ZZZZ under Cat II weather conditions with heavy rain and winds to an uneventful landing. Weather conditions remained the same during our three hour ground time up to our departure time. After a long taxi; we departed Runway XXR 700 Kilos under our (takeoff weight was limited by our max landing weight) limit for ZZZ. The First Officer (FO) had an uneventful takeoff; climb and level off at FL260. I departed the flight deck to change into a cruise shirt as the CA was going on first break. I was to relieve the Captain and take my seat. As I reentered the flight deck; the Crew was monitoring a high engine vibration on #2 and was considering a SATCOM call to Dispatch/Maintenance to discuss. About 5 min later and still in ZZZZ airspace; with me in the observer seat; we received a Main Deck Fire Warning. The flight was now approximately 25 minutes in flight. The Main Deck Fire Warning was not continuous but would cycle on and off. We had no smell or elevated temperatures. I offered to run checklists while the FO was still pilot flying (PF) and the Captain remained as pilot monitoring (PM). We also received an EICAS Advisory - Eng Gen #1. As I worked through the QRH checklists; getting ACARS ATIS; running performance for our weight; the Crew was struggling to communicate with ZZZZ control as the language barrier was very difficult for them to understand our needs. I also messaged Dispatch to advise our intentions. Dispatch asked if we wanted fire assistance and I responded - Yes. We cruised at FL260 for approximately 15 min before we started our descent. The Captain was now the PF. With weather conditions very low; the Captain elected to Cat II auto land to Runway XXL as it was approved to Cat II conditions. We had just landed the same runway earlier so we knew this runway was approved for Cat II. We/crew did not object. I had run performance to Cat II/III and wet runway to ensure we had landing performance. Landing distance required was approximately 9100 ft. and we had approximately 13;100 ft. We made an uneventful flaps 25 (for flap relief protections) landing at approximately 375 kilo tons; 78 Kilo tons over our make landing weight of max limit weight of 296;195 Kilo tons. Touchdown and rollout with Max Auto Brake (per QRH) was very smooth. We were then met by firefighters after stopping on the runway. Over the radio; we asked for aircraft inspection and advised fire crews to remain clear of tires and wheels as they were now showing elevated temperatures. I believe the crew also reviewed the EICAS Brake Temp checklist as they were consulting the Brake Temperature Monitoring System (BTMS) and QRH Brake Cooling charts. As the firefighters approached the airplane I could hear water being sprayed on the aircraft but we did not ask for water. As I opened the L1 door for the firefighters; the main deck cargo was still very wet. I did look outside and could see the wing gear had steam or smoke emitting from the brakes with lots of water in the area. We were not carrying any declared Hazard Materials but were carrying some approved excepted items. After a thorough aircraft search by the firefighters; we stayed on board and waited further instructions. The ZZZZ station manager then met us and asked for us to get towed in which he coordinated. We then ran checklists and was towed to stand XXX. The regulator then came by asked for a Captain statement and checked all crew for licenses and medicals. He also took many pictures of the FP (Flight Plan); manuals and crew and spent time in the flight deck area with another agent. A Flight Operations rep then came by and asked what guidance we used regarding overweight landing and firefighter use of water on the brakes.I believe the extreme full cargo load (cargo was floor to ceiling in all but one pallet position) on the main deck was completely soaked; having too much moisture. There may have been some other water ingress in the L1 floor area as a ramp/load ZZZZ crew member asked for a towel to keep the area dry; may have caused other indications problems. Guidance could include to set cabin altitude to manual 8;000 feet for takeoff to allow for more air passage thru the entire airframe. Once top of climb go back to auto along with the other checklist items. Descent actions may not need to include a cabin altitude adjustment as dry cabin air will more than likely dry off any remaining moisture. Any Boeing service bulletins should also be completed.",,"B747 flight crew reported receiving a Fire Warning Bell with no associated EICAS. The overhead panel Main Deck Fire Light was illuminated.

Was told by contract maintenance that didn't look good; but Operations wants an engine run up for five minutes. We coordinated engine runup with operations and had contract maintenance supervision. We started the number two engine and observed ITT jump to +500. We aborted the start and engine ITT (Interstage Turbine Temperature) dropped to around 200 and then spiked up to 940. I pulled the fire handle to stop the fuel. Contract maintenance came back; and I described what happened. We called maintenance controller as well and I gave them the same description. When we got off the phone. The second contact maintenance guy comes in and says they're still fire in engine. To put out fire contact maintenance instructed us dry motor engine. Which required the fire handle to be stowed. Contract maintenance called fire department. When the dry motor was complete I went out to inspect with contract maintenance.

Called Maintenance and advised of what just happened and that fire department had been called. Cause was trying to do an engine runup. Did not think like it was a good idea but had maintenance asking for it. Do not think controller knew how big leak really it was. Would have liked to have spoken out on feeling uncomfortable with doing an engine runup and given my advice not to do it.",,"We landed in ZZZ without issue. I went to do my post flight walk-around and discovered a fuel leak on the number 2 engine. I had the captain come out and look at it; and then he wrote it up. He called [company] maintenance and then we waited for contract maintenance to come take a look. We were told by maintenance to start and run the number 2 engine for 5 minutes. We coordinated for the start with ops; contract maintenance; and ground. During engine start; the ITT (Interstage Turbine Temperature) spiked quickly; and then started dropping rapidly. I performed the QRC memory item for engine abnormal start and turned the start/stop selector to stop. After this; the ITT spikes past redline; into the 900s. The captain pulled the fire handle and the ITT goes down. We get an engine exceedance message; but no fire messages. We talk to contract maintenance and [company] maintenance about what happened. Then a second contract maintenance employee who was monitoring outside comes to tell us there are flames coming out of the engine. Contract maintenance instructs us to dry motor the engine and then monitors outside while we do so. The fire department is called. After dry motoring; the captain walks outside to talk to contract maintenance; and just after he leaves the ITT starts to spike right past redline again. I pull the fire handle and the ITT goes down. Still no fire message. We then remain on the plane to monitor the ITT temperature. Because I am not an A&P; I don't want to speculate about what the causes were in terms of what happened in the engine; but other causes could have been the fuel leak itself; direction from maintenance; and pilot action. In terms of avoiding a recurrence or a similar event; I feel like I can only evaluate my own actions. The main thing that I have been thinking about is how uncomfortable I felt about the direction to start the engine. I should have voiced this discomfort. I let the fact that I felt that I was the least experienced person in the situation stand in the way of voicing my opinion and making my own decision on how to act/not act.

We attempted to determine configuration through the company parts hotline who were confused. Then; ZZZ Engineering stepped in to determine effectivity as the IPC (Illustrated Parts Catalog) was extremely complex and convoluted for this part. I; Supervisor; was provided IPC references; and an Airbus FCDC interchangeability logic table; then provided clear pathway to prove effectivity for a Pre-Mod XXXXX A319 aircraft. We were assured it was effective via these references and guiding us through them; Avionics and I. The avionics technicians were fine with that and installed the deemed effective FCDC into aircraft and it tested fine with no faults. I signed off the log page and the aircraft was released and flew away to ZZZ1. Engineering came back and said they had dug through induction paperwork and found that Aircraft X; that we just signed off on; was actually a Post-Mod XXXXX aircraft; and the new logic table showed the part to be not effective and we would now have an inspection situation on our hands. I immediately contacted Maintenance Control and let them know the aircraft was flying with a non-effective part and they took it from there.I signed off and cleared the log page as a Supervisor with the wrong IPC and logic data provided to me by Engineering and wanted it on the record. The technicians were notified as they did the installation and parts rob. While the part functioned correctly; it was only for a pre-mod aircraft; not a post-mod aircraft like Aircraft X.

They had reset the Speed Brake Handle few times; but the Light would come back on every time. So; they called Maintenance and the Station Maintenance. I have checked the MEL and learned that such malfunction may or may not be deferred; depending on location of the fault. I have decided to delay boarding. The Station Maintenance Mechanics did go through their procedure checklist and came to the conclusion that the Speed Brake System operates normally and the Fault is in a monitoring System. So; the Fault in a Monitoring System was deferrable and they start their paper work. I have checked the specific MEL and called Maintenance in ZZZ1. Maintenance Control confirmed that we are good to go; but in case the Speed Brake Extended Light will continue causing a problem; they will ask me in ZZZ2 to remove the Respective Light Bulbs. During taxi out; the Light came on; I had reset the Speed Brake Handle; but Light would come back on few seconds later. During pre-takeoff check the Takeoff Configuration Horn came on. We have checked the takeoff configuration and everything was good. The cause of the horn was well known and I proposed to continue. The takeoff configuration horn sounded during takeoff roll and silenced right at airborne. The rest of the flight was uneventful.

I was the pilot flying; so I told Person A that I had the radios and asked them to run the associated Non-normal Checklist. I was not familiar with this malfunction; but it became immediately clear that there was a possibility that we may have to shut down the engine. I asked Person A to hold on for a second and I transmitted to ATC that we wanted to level off at FL190 in order to work a possible engine problem and that I would get back to them with more information shortly; which was approved as requested. Realizing the possible severity of the situation and the possibility of some very challenging checklists ahead; I decided to swap roles and have Person A fly and run the comms; while I ran the associated checklists for the problem. I started the checklist; which called for turning off the autothrottle and retarding the engine until either the message goes out or it is at idle. I coordinated this with Person A so that they could smoothly apply the needed rudder to compensate for the loss of thrust; which went very smoothly all the way to idle with the message still illuminated. I then knew we were going to shut down the engine; so I took the radios back and with ATC; told them we were returning to ZZZ and needed a turn back toward the airport; and would like to enter a holding pattern in order to run the checklists; and that I would get back to them shortly with the rest of their required information. I then sent a CALL ME message to Dispatch and; while I awaited their reply; I called the Purser and asked them to get out their device because I needed to give them the briefing. They got out the device and I told them that we had to shut down an engine; we are not planning an evacuation; there are no special instructions; we would be returning to ZZZ and landing in about 15 minutes; and that I would make an announcement to the passengers soon.I then called Dispatch on the frequency I was sent; but the transmission was broken and unreadable; so I sent a DIVERT message with a quick note about shutting down an engine and returning to ZZZ. I then went to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist and secured the engine accordingly; turned on the APU for power; and called ATC back with fuel and souls onboard and asked them for a lower altitude. They gave us 12;000 ft.; which caused us to have to use engine anti-ice during the descent; which I selected on for the operational engine. During this time they were vectoring us in an extended holding type pattern. I decided this was a good time to brief the passengers. In a calm voice; I told them that we had to shut down one of our engines; we would be returning to ZZZ; please follow all instructions from the flight attendants; and that I would talk to them on the ground shortly.I then continued to the One Engine Inoperative Landing Checklist down to the items including the Non-normal Configuration Landing Distance table for our aircraft. We were well below max landing weight for the 900ER. At this point; I checked in with Person A to make sure they were ok and on board with everything that we had done up to that point; which they were. I decided to quickly type a more detailed message to Dispatch stating that we had in fact shut down the Left Engine and would be landing in ZZZ soon; to which they replied that everyone had been advised and that we should return to Gate XXX.I then got landing data for [Runway] XYR; loaded and briefed the ILS including the complex procedure for that runway; adjusted the target speed on the FMS approach page; and since we were in heading mode on vectors; I extended the runway centerline off of ZZZZZ1 with a 284 inbound course. I asked Person A if they wanted to also brief the approach because they were going to be flying it; but they were satisfied with everything I had set up for the approach. I then asked for lower so that we could run the Deferred Items Checklist. When we got below 10;000 ft.; I configured the bleed panel; reviewed the flaps 1 go-around with the procedure; and told ATC we were ready for the approach. We were given a vector to intercept the XYR localizer; and since were over 25 miles from the airport; I told Person A that we would need to use LNAV until we were closer in for a better localizer signal. As we rolled wings level; I went to select LNAV but realized the FMS had re-sequenced and the final course was off of the FAF and the magenta line was not far enough out for us to intercept. As I was correcting this problem; we got a TA for an aircraft below us. My immediate concern was that we may have overshot the final approach course; so I told Person A to initiate a right turn and spun the heading bug about 15 degrees right. It turned out that we had not overshot the final and the traffic was just someone climbing out below us and leveling 1;000 ft. below our altitude. I finished extending the centerline off of ZZZZZ1 and rejoined the final. At around 15 miles out we selected approach mode and started configuring for landing. Reaching flaps 15; I ran the Landing Checklist and we proceeded to land uneventfully and taxied to the gate. I thanked the passengers for their understanding and cooperation; then called Dispatch and the Chief Pilot.",,,,"B737 Captain reported an Oil Filter Bypass Light caution message appeared while climbing that required an engine shutdown as part of the checklists.

While allowed per MEL; I do not like to fly over water on one pack; especially at night; and even more so when it's the first flight on a single pack. So I contacted Operations Control via Dispatch to ask for a different aircraft. Operations Control said none were available. I also emailed the Duty Chief Pilot for assistance but they never got back to me before departure time. I considered refusing the aircraft; but the FO (First Officer) and I chose not to. We planned to monitor the pressurization system more closely; knowing it was degraded. We boarded and departed on time. Initial climb-out was uneventful. Passing 10;000 ft.; we took a close look at the pressurization parameters and all looked normal. We continued to climb to FL290. We were busy in the climb conducting the numerous procedures required for Class II operations. After a few minutes at FL290 we were cleared to climb to FL330.As we initiated the climb; the Lower ECAM switched to the PRESS page and displayed the Cabin Altitude Advisory; flashing at 8;800 ft. and climbing. I pushed the V/S knob to level off at approximately FL294. It appeared that with Pack 1 OFF per MEL; our one remaining pack was 'weak' and not able to fully pressurize the aircraft. We noted the outflow valve was closed. No ECAM cautions or warnings were present.Since the cabin altitude continued to climb even while level at FL294; I directed the FO to request an immediate descent to 10;000 ft. ZZZ Center cleared us right away to descend and maintain 10;000 ft. I selected 10;000 ft. in the FCU (Fuel Control Unit) and began an open descent. At this point the cabin altitude indicated above 9;550 ft. and turned red; so I proactively announced "emergency descent" even though the cabin altitude was still below 10;000 ft. The FO read the QRC checklist and I began a descent with autopilot off and spoilers fully extended. At the same time I stated out loud; 'We need to go back to ZZZ.' The FO advised ATC of our descent and the desire to return to ZZZ. We were additionally cleared to turn right direct ZZZ. Once the descent was established; we began the right turn towards ZZZ. I noticed no traffic at all within 20 NM of the aircraft during the descent and turn back via TCAS on ND (Navigation Display); and out the windows. I selected Terrain on ND to ensure we were over water as expected. It was a pitch black night with no horizon or visual cues.As we descended; the cabin altitude continued to climb above 9;550 ft. but at a slower rate. Then approximately halfway through the descent; the Master Warning sounded as the cabin altitude reached 10;000 ft. Shortly thereafter the cabin began to descend as the aircraft got lower. I recall the cabin was only 100 - 200 ft. above 10;000 ft. for approximately 20 seconds. We did not don oxygen masks when the cabin altitude reached 10;000 ft. due to the high workload of hand-flying the descent on instruments and the transient nature of the excessive cabin altitude. We felt the priority was on maintaining safe control of the aircraft. A320 FCOM (Flight Crew Operations Manual) 1 paragraph 5.1.2 states; "the pilot flying will be tasked with verifying the non-normal condition and confirming procedures… (but) it should not distract the pilot flying from his primary duty of safely flying the aircraft." However upon reflection; if the situation was progressing to the point where I thought declaring "emergency descent" was warranted; putting on our oxygen masks before beginning the descent would have been the better course of action. Upon leveling at 10;000 ft. we slowed to 250 kt.; re-engaged the autopilot; verified we were navigating direct to ZZZ as cleared; and assessed the situation. The cabin altitude was below 10;000 ft. and cabin vertical speed was at -250 FPM; descending. In fact as we transited back at 10;000 ft.; the cabin continued to descend normally and reached field elevation before we landed. We heard no unusual sounds indicating a leak of any kind. I next called the cabin to advise them of the situation and to check in on the cabin condition. They said everything was okay and the oxygen masks did not deploy. I told the F1 we were returning to ZZZ; landing in about 25 minutes. I said the landing would be normal but CFR (Crash Fire Rescue) may meet the aircraft. Next; we advised Dispatch via ACARS of our descent and plan to return to ZZZ. We initially set up the FMS for a return to ZZZ and ran the Overweight Landing Checklist. Planned landing weight was 154;000 lb. I then asked Dispatch if they preferred we go to ZZZ or ZZZ1; in case one was better than the other for our situation. Dispatch told us Operations Control preferred we go to ZZZ1 to facilitate an easier tail swap. We coordinated with ZZZ Center to divert to ZZZ1 and we reprogrammed the FMS again for ZZZ1. I continued to fly the aircraft and talk with ATC while the FO reprogrammed the FMS both times. ATC [provided priority handling] for us due to the descent; diversion; and planned overweight landing; and we concurred. I advised the flight attendants of our new plan to go to ZZZ1 and asked them to make a PA since we were in a descent below 10;000 ft. at this point and our workload was very high. The rest of the descent; approach and landing; ILS XXR ZZZ; were normal. Medium brakes were used per [the] software and max reverse per the Overweight Landing Checklist. Touchdown was in the touchdown zone at 200 FPM or less. ZZZ emergency equipment was dispatched to a location near the runway but they never approached the aircraft. We exited [Runway] XXR at [Taxiway] XX and taxied to [Taxiway] XY Gate XX normally.Brake fan use was delayed until brake temperatures reached 400°C on the left main gear; approximately 4 minutes after landing. Winds were 320 at 16 kt. for landing on [Runway] XXR. Brake temperatures never went much above 400°C and then began to cool. At the gate we wrote up the loss of pressurization and overweight landing. We debriefed Maintenance Control crew members face-to-face. We never ran the 'Diversion' checklist since both ZZZ and ZZZ1 are primary and well-known cities - we prioritized other necessary tasks. I provided the flight attendants all the information required for an event but I believe I may have failed to speak the words 'event' directly. The flight attendants confirmed with me after the flight that it was clear to them that it would be an event/normal landing.",,,,"A320 Captain reported the cabin was not pressurizing properly and the flight crew opted to divert.

The aircraft was approximately 2 hours late inbound from ZZZ2. The delay was caused by a maintenance issue. While taxiing out in ZZZ2 the crew encountered an ECAM for 'F/CTL SPLR FAULT." They returned to the gate and Maintenance Control performed a reset. They then departed for ZZZ. While enroute; the same fault reappeared. They wrote up the spoiler fault on arrival to ZZZ and Maintenance Control came out to the aircraft. They performed a reset and signed off the logbook. We pushed back from the gate. During the first engine start; the ECAM reappeared: F/CTL SPLR FAULT. After completing the non-normal procedures for this ECAM; we consulted the Computer Reset Table and followed the procedure to reset the spoiler fault. This reset was unsuccessful. The reset procedure specifically prohibits more than one reset attempt - so; after advising the flight attendants and customers; we returned to the gate. The same two maintenance control personnel returned to the aircraft. They advised me that Maintenance Control directed them to apply MEL 27-XX-XXX Spoiler Surfaces. This MEL allowed us to depart with one pair of symmetrical surfaces inoperative. They deactivated the inboard spoilers on each wing. The two technicians handed me the logbook and departed the aircraft. Several minutes later they returned and pulled and collared the circuit breaker for SEC 3. When I asked about this procedure they confirmed it was part of the task list to apply MEL 27-XX-XXX. They finished their work and we pushed back from the gate.After starting both engines I reviewed the MEL again. It advises that I should see the ECAM "Spoiler Fault." We did not have that ECAM displayed. I also examined the flight control system page and noticed that four of our spoilers were inoperative - not two as prescribed in the MEL. I also performed a flight control check and verified that four of our spoilers were not deploying. I could not reconcile the MEL guidance with what I was seeing on the flight deck. I then called Maintenance Control but could not get through. I called my Dispatcher and she was able to connect me to Maintenance Control. I described what I was observing and Maintenance Control told me "that doesn't sound right." He advised us to return to gate. I advised the crew and customers and we returned to the gate again. We were approaching the duty time limit so we deplaned the customers. The same two technicians returned to the aircraft. I was in the jet bridge talking with my crew when; after about 5 minutes; the technicians informed the gate agents that they were done and the aircraft was "good to go." They performed an incomplete Securing Checklist; shut off the APU with customers still onboard; and departed without telling me anything they had done. The flight attendants and most of the customers were not comfortable returning to the same aircraft. I asked the gate agents to call the 2 technicians back out to the aircraft so they could explain to me what they had done to make the aircraft airworthy again. They explained to me that Maintenance Control had sent them the wrong task list and all they had to do was reset the circuit breaker for SEC 3. I confirmed with them that the flight control computer had been deactivated in error.After the second gate return; myself and First Officer exceeded our duty limit for the day and were removed from the flight.

However; CFI proceeded to take off on the roll from run-up. Full throttle with rich mixture; all instruments showed no issue as airspeed came alive.

This was in shadow due to the lighting; I believed this to be the traffic I was following and that number 1 was ahead and not in sight. This proved to be incorrect; the aircraft light I saw was in fact the number one aircraft; a helicopter. I turned final to follow this aircraft; and immediately after turning final; the other aircraft on left approach; a Cessna; appeared turning final above; ahead and to my left. They saw me below and did a go-around at this point.I believe parts of this area may not be easily visible from the Tower. I believe the issues are aircraft simultaneously on left and right approaches; limited visibility due to low sun angle and terrain leaving the final approach course in shadow looking from the east; lack of clarity about the position of the two preceding aircraft in the pattern; probable lack of direct visibility from the Tower; and my failure to clearly state that I could see one aircraft; not both; and to confirm with the Tower whether the aircraft I saw over the lake was number one or number two.",,,,"AC11 pilot flying reported an NMAC event while turning final approach with another aircraft turning final from opposite base.

This plug was safety wired to an angled piece of aluminum that was riveted to the drain plug cover plate that is secured to the airframe. These aftermarket STCed quick drains are made of aluminum. The aircraft recently came out of annual and had about 2.5 hours in service at the time of the event. During the annual all engine mounts were replaced. The oil was changed. And a visual inspection of the drain plug safety wire confirmed it was attached to the aluminum bracket in the nose gear portion of the airframe.Upon entering the pattern at ZZZ on a return flight from ZZZ1; it was observed that the engine oil pressure was at the lower limit at 30 PSI. After landing and while taxiing to the FBO it was observed that oil pressure dropped to 0 PSI. Engine temperature was normal and no anomalies were detected. Upon shutdown and exiting the aircraft engine oil was observed; of oil covering the entire undercarriage of the airframe from tip to tail. Oil dropped; puddled; and pooled under the aircraft. Upon further inspection it was discovered that the oil plug was missing. The hole in the aluminum bracket safety wire attachment point was worn through; negating the usefulness of the safety wire. The service shop at ZZZ replaced the plug with an original certificated plug and safety wired to the engine and NOT the airframe.It's believed that the failure of the drain plug to stay safely secured was caused by it being secured to the airframe; which with the engine running was able to vibrate its way loose. Further investigation revealed that it's a common practice to secure this aftermarket quick drain plug valve to the airframe because it extends through the access plate; making it convenient but not effective. In hindsight I'm glad we didn't drop the oil while climbing out over ZZZ2 in Day 0. Otherwise I might not have been able to write this. I hope this information is helpful and gets disseminated as soon as possible. I shared my experience with the service personnel that performed my annual. They had an A36 Bonanza in their shop also with the same drain plug secured to the airframe.

Uneventful departure; climb and en route phase of flight. We were in contact with ZZZ Center when cleared direct ZZZZZ for RNAV GPS Runway XX into ZZZ1. We had already setup; reviewed and briefed the RNAV GPS XX approach into ZZZ1 when we received clearance to cross ZZZZZ at or above 11000 ft; cleared RNAV GPS Runway XX into ZZZ1. First Officer (FO) had the terrain feature selected so we could monitor our position in relation with the rising terrain that was soon to be off of our left; east side; of the aircraft to ensure we maintained high situational awareness during the turn. Everything in the 'box' looked correct and was depicting a smart turn to cross ZZZZZ and then proceed inbound on course to ZZZZZ1. Just prior to ZZZZZ we entered IMC; 11000 and 210 KIAS; as the plane began its right turn. We encountered moderate chop to light turbulence in the turn along with a gusting tailwind. This caused us to overshoot the turn and we were unable to stay on course to ZZZZZ1. At this time I was looking at the potential of reversing our turn to then complete the full approach with procedure turn.This was not remotely feasible and I requested to continue our turn direct to ZZZZZ1. ZZZ Center came over the radio; informed us of the minimum VFR terrain clearance altitude; cancelled our approach clearance and instructed us to continue our right turn back to ZZZZZ; climb and maintain 14000 ft. with which we complied.

I asked the Captain what they heard and; if I recall correctly; they responded with 30.36 - which I then set in the Kollsman window for when we were to transition. They later stated they would be off of Comm #1 to get the ATIS into ZZZ and eventually came back with a 30.41 altimeter setting. We set our altimeters; ran our approach checklist; and proceeded to follow ATC's instructions. Once on final we agreed we both had the runway in sight and were to use visual callouts. Shortly after; we started to receive a 'caution obstacle' alert; to which I disengaged the autopilot and stopped the descent. Soon after; followed a 'glideslope' alert and the Captain quickly realized this was due to an incorrect altimeter setting. I was able to set the correct altimeter setting and establish the aircraft on the glideslope; fully configured and stable by 500 ft.Only suggestions to myself. When reading back 'altimeters verify set three times' during the approach checklist; I will now not only look for 3 matching altimeters; but verify I myself have checked the ATIS.",,"On descent to ZZZ I listened to the ATIS and we set the altimeters to 30.37 inches. We were descended in ZZZ1's Class B and were sent over the top of ZZZ1. I don't recall if we leveled off at any altitude or just descended the entire time. We were vectored onto the approach; told to maintain 3;000 ft. until established and cleared for the ILS XX. Weather was low scattered clouds and we saw the airport as we turned onto the localizer. At the time we became established on the localizer we were already inside of ZZZZZ so the pilot flying selected 2;600 ft. and descended; I don't believe we ever leveled at 3;000 ft. as we were kept a bit high. During that descent we received a yellow terrain alert due to a tower on the approach track as I recall our descent rate was 1;600 FPM and I had the pilot flying shallow out the descent. We got a glideslope warning and around that time I realized that we were about at the FAF but our radar altimeter read something like 750 ft. I received an altimeter setting - I don't remember if I asked Tower for it or heard him give it to someone else on frequency - of 29.41 inches. Our altimeters were set almost an entire inch high; putting us almost 1;000 ft. low. The pilot flying arrested the descent and we continued the approach without further incident. At no point were we queried on our altitude by ATC. As I said; I don't recall if we ever leveled off at an altitude so I'm not really sure if there was an altitude deviation.A few takeaways from this. First; 29.41 inches is a very low altimeter setting. Neither of us can recall seeing it that low. We instinctively heard the '.41' part of the setting and automatically decided it was 30.41 inches. Second; we should have gone around after realizing we were low. We had the runway in sight and continued. We both agreed later that going around was the better plan. The third is it would be hard to not figure some kind of fatigue in this. This happened late in the day; I was about at hour 12. It was our first and only leg of the day; it was day 1 for both of us. However; the day was very chaotic with lots of last-minute changes. I show 18 different brief updates.Somehow setting the altimeters correctly would be the first suggestion. We both did the 18;000 ft. altimeter check as well as the check as part of the approach checklist. I heard the setting on the ATIS and from Approach. We both were expecting 30.41 inches so we both heard that. Fighting that expectation bias is important. Second would be making a habit of confirming the radio altimeter on approach - that would have clued us in to the issue.",,"EMB-505 flight crew reported the incorrect altimeter setting was entered and the flight crew received an obstacle alert during final approach.",

I am a Captain that had an issue with Contract Maintenance having to do a pressurization test at the gate once I arrived at the gate. The previous Captain who brought the plane in wrote in the log; intermittent whistle on the L1 Door; which is the reason for the test. I have never been on an airplane during a pressurization test. During the test; we had the doors closed with me; Contract Maintenance in the flight deck - only one Maintenance guy was present - and the flight attendants sitting in the cabin. The First Officer was on the jet bridge. Company Maintenance emailed the appropriate procedure to my iPad; because the Contractor did not have access to email; which I pulled up the procedure and gave it to Maintenance. Part of the procedure was to clear the ramp area which I had the First Officer do and have all the doors closed and locked. Then; I was asked by the Contractor to put the pressurization mode into manual and adjust the cabin altitude to the down position and close the outflow valve. They did not seem to know where the knobs were so I showed him and put the knobs where they should be and adjusted it; holding the knob in the down position. I did not close the valve all the way because the pressure change was rapid and got really uncomfortable and the psi was climbing quickly as well. Cabin altitude rate was 3;000 - 4;000 FPM and differential pressure was 4.3 at maximum. I really had no direction nor did Maintenance seem to care if the procedure was done properly. I opened the outflow valve; opened the doors; and they signed off the logbook with no apparent leak in the pressurization and we went on our way to ZZZ. After leaving I reviewed the procedure and realized that Contract Maintenance did not go through the procedure step-by-step and deviated from proper procedure. They ignored many safety warnings; including everyone having medical clearance to be on board during the test and not have underlying health issues; and if the procedure isn't followed correctly it could cause injury or damage to the aircraft. The flight attendants should not have been on board. Thankfully there was no one that was injured and the aircraft did not seem to be damaged.The procedure was more involved than just closing the outflow valve. The packs and bleeds were supposed to be off during the initial test; which is where the deviation began. With the bleeds and packs off the outflow valve should be closed then opened again. The next step is to then turn the APU bleed on and use either Pack 1 or Pack 2 to pressurize the cabin and follow AMM (Aircraft Maintenance Manual) task to supply pneumatic power through the APU.I am not a Mechanic and do not know the procedure and I do not know what was communicated between the Contractor and Company Maintenance. I put the safety of myself and my flight attendants in the hands of Contract Maintenance; which I regret and wish I handled it better. Next time I will surely include Company Maintenance and have them walk through the procedure step-by-step and see that it is performed properly and safety is not compromised. Follow proper procedure; follow checklist.",,,,"ERJ-170 Captain reported procedures were not followed by Contract Maintenance during a ground pressurization check to ensure proper operation of the cabin pressure control system.

Aircraft was taken out of service and remained overnight. I worked graveyard shift on overtime and got assigned to troubleshoot the issue with the slapping chain for the electric trim. I adjusted the lower and bottom control turnbuckles in reference to the Aircraft Maintenance Manual with no help. Troubleshot the issue some more and found that the chain was still really loose. I adjusted the spool bolts by turning the nuts less then 1/4-inch. This fixed the issue and the chain was in limits per the Maintenance Manual. The technicians that initially found the issue that the chain was loose found that the chain had been rubbing on a frame in the pedestal.Talking to Management; it was determined that the damage wasn't that bad so the Management team edited the original write-up and deleted the pictures when I went to sign the original write-up off. There was no write-up in Maintenance saying there was any damage. I signed the aircraft off and Aircraft X was returned to service. Forty five minutes later the Inspector that performed my RII (Required Inspection Item) function; Person A; determined the Upper Turnbuckle Rod End was bent after they had already signed the aircraft of as being airworthy. They determined the Rod End was bent because they went and looked at other MAX aircraft. I ordered a new Rod End and I continued to be on shift. The Rod End came in at XF:00. I installed the new serviceable Rod End and rigged the Rod End in reference to Maintenance Manual. Inspector proceeds to tell me that they rewrote the damage up because they were accusing me of deleting the write-up and removing the pictures of the damage; which I can't do but Management can.Aircraft X goes back out of service and is still in ZZZ; has never flown since the initial squawk. I feel like I did nothing wrong and am getting accused of things I did that never happened and as far as the Rod End being bent. I looked at other aircraft and it didn't look bent to me but it was bent. The Inspector has the final say and they didn't see it either because they released the aircraft back into service. The aircraft is still here in ZZZ getting the Elevator Trim Chain replaced and the damage blended out so the aircraft hasn't flown since the initial discrepancy.Get inspectors trained on the aircraft because it's obvious [the] Inspector didn't know what they were looking for because why did they initially sign it off. Inspection is the final say.",,"On Day 0; I was scheduled the duty of RII (Required Inspection Item) buyback for Aircraft X inbound write-up; 'Trim wheel makes loud noises while trimming all places.' At the beginning of the shift I began looking into the discrepancy. While reviewing the write-up; I saw 4 total pictures where AMT B shows they discovered the Stab Trim Control Chain being very loose. Two of the photos showed a zoomed in view of what appeared to be structural damage where the chain had worn grooves into the structure as a result of it being loose. Shortly after the beginning of the shift; my Supervisor informed me that the decision was to not work that aircraft on the overnight shift. At around XA:00; I received a phone call from the Lead that they were ready for inspection buyback for the chain adjustment. I had explained that I was told it wasn't being worked; otherwise I would have been there from the start of the task; but I would go and be able to check the adjustment.While looking in the Forward EE Bay; I found that the upper turnbuckle had a bent Rod End. When I talked to the Mechanic that did the adjustment AMT A; I asked if they saw the bent Rod End. They said they had originally thought it was bent also; but had compared it to another aircraft and that it was 'supposed to be that way.' AMT A is a well known knowledgeable Mechanic so I believed they had done as they said so I went ahead and signed off the chain adjustment since that in itself was correct and I wrongly made the decision to WAIT on making a write-up about the Rod End until I had done more research and verified myself. Also while in the EE I searched for the suspected damage that I had seen earlier; which I did not find. After not seeing the damage; I decided to review the photos again to help me locate where the photo was taken. At this point I find in tracking system that TWO out of the four photos have been removed from the discrepancy; and no write-ups have been made that addressed the suspected damage. I asked the two mechanics if they knew what happened to the missing photos. Their response was NO. I asked if they deleted the photos. Their response was NO; and that [the] tracking system did not give the mechanics the ability to remove photos. The mechanics acknowledged that there were other photos attached but did not know what happened to them.I asked AMT B where the suspected damage was located; and they explained it could only be seen from the cockpit behind the pedestal panels that were already re-installed; but that the damage 'looked worse than it really was in the pictures; and that it was only paint.' At this point I wrongly thought that I would be outside of my scope of inspection to have the mechanics re-open the panels for what they say was 'only paint.' So at this point the adjustment is signed off because the tensions showed to be within limits. The plane was released to service due to the Lead not knowing the Rod End was found bad. I should have made a more timely write-up for the Rod End so that the work package wouldn't be closed. I informed them that the Rod End was found to be bad and that I would be creating a new work package write-up to replace the Upper Turnbuckle Rod End. The aircraft becomes AOG for the turnbuckle.When the day shift Supervisor comes in; I inform them of everything above including the missing photos; and my suspicion on if there is damage I saw in the photos. They explained I was wrong about staying within my scope; and that if I suspect damage that we should get the panels back open and verify. After opening the panels we found the damage was more than 'paint' - [it] was two grooves in the structure as a result of the chain riding on the structure. The damage was 0.100 inches width with a depth of 0.050 inches.In conclusion; although I made the write-ups in the end; I should have made the turnbuckle write-up as soon as I found it; regardless of whether there was uncertainty on if it was correct or not. Regarding the suspected damage; I should have made the call immediately to remove the panels so I could verify if there was damage that I believe I saw in the missing photos. In the future I will immediately write up discrepancies and THEN investigate whether they are right or wrong. I will do this in order to prevent the work package being closed and released to service with a suspected discrepancy. As far as the suspected damage goes; I know now that any suspected damage should immediately be investigated and documented even if I believe it is outside of my scope. As Quality Control Inspector it is my job to investigate any suspected damage regardless of scope in order to provide a safe aircraft.

This was pilot error.",,"Day 0; Aircraft X; ZZZ. Emergency electrical failure. I arrived at the airport an hour before XA:00 departure. Person A; Equipment Company Captain; arrived 20 minutes later. I then went out to the airplane to start my preflight checks; all were normal. While getting our items situated in the airplane; Person A looked to be in their normal self with mentioning [they] had a head cold and was ready to go home. The passengers arrived out on the ramp; we loaded luggage; and were ready to start up. We did the Before-Start Checklist; then Person A proceeded to start the engines; I programmed the GPS; collected ATIS; and I ran the After-Start Checklist. All systems appeared to be normal. We proceeded to get taxi clearance to Runway XX. Prior to takeoff; Person A did an engine run-up. Everything was normal. I called the Tower; we were cleared for takeoff; I ran the Clear for Takeoff Checklist; and all systems appeared to be normal after Person A's completion of each check. We proceeded with a normal takeoff and climb; and with a positive rate the gear came up; After-Takeoff Checklist was completed; and all was normal at that time.Tower called to hand us over to Departure. I responded and proceeded by switching over to call Departure; 'Aircraft X 900 for 2;000 RH.' On our first call; Departure said that we were unreadable and to switch to their other frequency. I heard Departure ask another aircraft if they could read us and they said they did not hear anything. I then switched to the new frequency; still unreadable. Person A tried from their side with no response. I dialed up Guard to see if we could get anyone there and at that time we lost communication.Person A was more concerned with the radios than focusing on flying the plane. We lost the autopilot. Person A then leveled off for a brief moment and then began an aggressive left bank followed by an equally aggressive descent. Person A did not verbally communicate their intentions or what they were doing. I then noticed Person A was physically shaking. I attempted to calm them by reassuring them to fly the airplane first. I quickly gave a direct to ZZZ on the GPS calling out the heading; recalling a south-southeast heading; for Person A to take. I then pushed in 7600 on the GPS and the GPS instantly went blank screen. We then descended through a thin cloud layer with the airport approximately 5 miles and to our 10 o'clock. As more electrical failures continued; Person A's body became even more visibly shaken along with the way they started calling out 'my gyro failed' [and] 'the generators failed.' I tried to calm Person A down; asking if all the switches were in the right position. I saw them look over left and move their hand over there telling me; 'Yes.' I said just fly the airplane; to parallel the runway flying downwind [Runway] XX; and do not lose sight of the airport.I then asked Person A where were they going and what their intentions were. Person A looked at me unresponsive with a blank stare which at that time; I decided to take the flight controls and talk them through the next steps. I told them I have the airport; I am going to level off; circle on base; and all we need is the gear down to land safely. I also asked Person A to briefly inform the passengers of what we are going to do. I was circling southeast of the airport; approximately 4 NM on final for [Runway] XX and 1;000-1;500 ft. I was well above the towers to my north and my south; had 4 white lights on the PAPI; and flying an airspeed between 120-130 kt.I was cleared to land with a steady green light gun. I recall Person A telling me not to over torque the engines; I said they are fine. In my mind I wanted the gear down; the airplane on the ground safely; and out of this situation. I told Person A we needed to manually lower the gear. They proceeded to do it without the Abnormal Checklist. I called for the checklist once; twice more assertively; and I said very slowly to read and do line-by-line. PersonA followed the checklist by putting the gear handle down; lifting the emergency engage handle and turning it clockwise; [and] they then began to pump the manual lever for the landing gear. The gear doors opened and the landing gear came down into place and Person A pumped until they couldn't anymore. I believed that the gear was down and locked but kept in mind the chance of it collapsing upon landing. I then proceeded to the airport on final for [Runway] XX. I talked Person A through my whole landing as they were telling me not to get too slow and not to stall. I told them; we are fine; I have this under control; I'm coming in above glideslope until I know for sure I have the runway made and then I will back off power. My aiming point was for the threshold knowing that I would float longer with no flaps in. I continued talking my way through the landing that once I had the runway made; I was going to land as slow as possible not knowing if the landing gear would collapse; and I would apply my rudder into the crosswind at the last moment. I landed smoothly at about 100 kt.; called for forward props; then I reversed thrust; and taxied off of [Taxiway] XX to the FBO Ramp.I debriefed the passengers that we had a total electrical loss and that we would have them go inside while Person A and I debriefed the event. I told Person A to call the Tower to make sure that they didn't need anything from us and to inform them what happened. They said they kept the airspace clear by holding all aircraft on the ground until we got in. They were very nice and happy that we were on the ground safely and didn't need us to do anything. I proceeded with having Person A call Person B with Company Maintenance. I had to step into the conversation to help explain the event as Person A was still shaken and at a loss of words. Also; I believe during Person A's conversation with Person B is when Person A realized that they had the starter switches in the 'On' position. I heard Person A make the comment on the phone that in regards to the starter switches being on; the generators still produce power. The cause of the event was confirmed the day after the event; Day 1; with Person A via text message: 'Yeah did a lot of King Air reading while sitting in airport. Starter stops actually starting automatically after 50% N even if turned back on. The starter system supersedes generator. Huge lesson learned. I must have flipped back on after hot 5; auto-feather and auto-ignition.' This could have been prevented by slowing down the flow in the airplane; making sure all switches are in the proper place; by performing the checklist as a crew by remaining calm; flying the airplane first; calling for the checklist to properly diagnose the electrical failure; and by having a Captain with experience to fly the airplane and handle emergency situations.",,"BE-200 flight crew reported losing communications and flight instruments after takeoff.

In the twenty plus years I have been flying in the Southwest region; I had flown in and out of the FMN many times (50 plus estimated). When Taxiing out from the FBO ramp to Runway 07; the 'A' taxiway used to run parallel to the runway for the whole length of the runway. The taxiway used to cross Runway 05 right at taxiway 'A'.  Apparently; as I found out after the incident; the airport re-located the taxiway to make a twenty degree turn when approaching Runway 05 and parallel 05 for a distance before crossing 05 further down.  I did check for airport NOTAMs prior to the flight but there were none related to that taxiway as the project had been completed about a year ago. Unfortunately; I had not been into FMN in about two years so was unaware of the new taxi route to [Runway] 07.Additionally; I nearly always fly/taxi with our company iPad mounted with suction cups to the left window with the airport diagram open. This particular night though; the iPad had fallen off of the window into my lap on the previous leg landing in FMN. I was planning on remounting it after cleaning the suction cups and the window once back at base so on this leg I had left it sitting in my flight bag on the co-pilot seat. I was not overly concerned about the lack of an open iPad to refer to as I had flown into that airport so many times before that I felt I new the correct route.  I was taxiing on 'A' slowly (I never taxi at faster than a brisk walk speed) when something ahead didn't look 'right' to me;  I slowed a bit more and stared at the end of the runway puzzled as to why what I was seeing did not match my mental picture of how I remember that taxiway to look. In that 5-8 seconds of looking up at the end of the runway the airplane must have reached the bend in the taxiway where it becomes taxiway 'B'.  I was rolling ahead slowly still on the direction of 'A' taxiway when the propeller hit the taxiway light. (I did not hear or feel a thing yet) and the airplane departed the taxiway and got stuck in the soft ground just on the side. Basically; the taxiway had turned but I did not. The propeller was damaged and is being replaced. This incident demonstrates what can happen when one's preconceived memory of things causes one to let one's guard down. Contributing factors were also not having the iPad open with the taxi diagram up. I should have at least checked the route prior to beginning movement.  As one additional suggestion if this is possible with the FAA's new signage policies; a sign on the right side of the taxiway with and arrow depicting the bend in the taxiway with destination references of Runway 07; and 07 on it in Yellow with Black would be helpful to alert pilots. The time of the night and having been up all night at that point was also a minor factor I'm sure as it is human nature to not be quite as sharp mentally during those middle of the night hours.

We thought this was very strange and they got within a few miles of us. At this time both us and the DC-3 got a traffic advisory from ZZZ Tower. We decided to turn west and descend - they mimicked this turn and gained closer. We noticed this again and started a steeper turn to the east and descended.

We opted to start both engines at the gate to ensure the #1 IDG (Integrated Drive Generator) came online correctly. All systems appeared to function normally. Climb-out; passing through the mid-teens; we had a Master Caution light illuminate with many systems illuminated on the recall. We analyzed the situation; initially thinking the light was the likely root cause of this situation; [and] quickly realizing that the issue was greater than just a TR (Transformer/Rectifier) failure. We started the QRH; we re-assessed the situation; and ran the QRH for a Left Generator failure. We noted that we did not have a Source Off light. Realizing that this was an entire system failure; based on a number of other system lights illuminated i.e.; 2 fuel pumps; a HYD ELEC PUMP; ANTI ICE; YD; etc.; we started the APU and got out of the QRH. The APU would not power the #1 Electrical Bus. I transferred control of the aircraft to the FO (First Officer) and I started coordinating with ZZZ Operations asking for a patch to Dispatch. FAs (Flight Attendant) called up and advised that they had absolutely no lights in the cabin. However; at some point during this event; the emergency lights did activate and give them some light in the cabin. Realizing that we lost ACARS during this even; we asked again for a patch to the Supervisor. Unable to get a patch; I spoke with ZZZ Local Maintenance on the radio and described what we had. Being that we were a single electrical system; and in agreement with their advice to return to ZZZ; we got priority handling into ZZZ. I made several PAs to the cabin; and several calls to the FAs to keep them informed on our intentions. I opted to use FMC-generated V/S and would use Autobrakes 3. On short final; the Autobrake Fail and Anti-Skid Fail lights illuminated. After landing; the APU and ground power would not power either side of the electrical system.

The flight was part of a [flight with a Check Airman] sequence. All appropriate checklists were completed and the aircraft returned to ZZZ for a successful; but overweight; landing. The biggest additive condition that occurred during this event was due to the multitude of requests for information from Dispatch during high workload times. Before we even had the chance to assess the engine condition; balance our response and communicate with ATC; there were 2 ACARS messages from Dispatch; followed by further requests; while we were executing the QRH Checklist; including the question; 'Did you [request priority handling]?'

All of these requests should have waited until the aircraft was at the gate.In a [situation] like this; requests for information; unless directly associated with ensuring a successful outcome; should be kept until the more immediate necessity of safely getting the aircraft on the ground has been accomplished. The numerous requests for information are an additive and task loading condition that the crew does not need while executing the QRH procedure. While I understand the need for information in the Company Operations Center; none of the requests were helpful to the crew.

First I often see ramp employees not using lighted wands in the morning before sun up. New ramp employees copying veteran ramp employees and not following SOP when unloading widebody aircraft. A fairly new ramp employee copying others by over-torquing a string of universal dollies to line up to a cargo loader to take the pallets off; when he could have and should have continued straight forward and when I asked why he was doing what he was doing (curving away from the cargo loader in a tight circle) he said that's how they do it. I questioned him further and he said the trainers said it was okay. Then I introduced myself and began to explain to him those procedures were not SOP and explained to him why he should cease the practice immediately; he said okay but a couple of hours later he was doing it again. A rookie crew and it seems like most crews don't cross the T when unloading widebody aircraft anymore. This particular crew was again unloading towards a B787 engine with some overhang on the pallets and two of the three said; yeah; we know and one of the ramp crew who was so green she didn't know she was supposed to give guidance to the ramp employee driving the tractor while offloading from the cargo loader. After they finished unloading the forward cargo pit the cargo loader driver hit the freight from behind after pulling away from the aircraft when one of the ramp employees was attempting to hook me up to the string of cargo on the four universal dollies and just barely got out of the way of the dollies as they moved forward. I asked the crew to work safer and watch out for one another. The driver of the cargo loader when asked did he know he hit the dollies said no. I advised the ramp employee he should file a report and that I would assist him; but he said they had another trip they needed to get to.A ramp employee informed me; but I have not confirmed this; but a new hire fresh off probation is a trainer; and that in itself is ridiculous. These new hires are training new hires. They don't have enough experience in the operation to train new personnel on SOP; nor do they have enough days on the ramp to give examples of situational awareness and historical consequences of non-adherence to SOP and the incidents from the past. New hires here cannot be identified because they aren't required to wear the vest; but their lack of efficiency screams loudly who they are. Now that I am back to work is shall continue send what I hope to become progress report on wild; crazy and scary situations happening on ZZZ ramp. By the way; the safety zone isn't so safe because of other companies driving through the safety zone because no one is managing the Ground Support Equipment parked between the gates from Company as well as other ramp service companies.",,,,"Ramp employee reported observing multiple procedural and safety issues of other ramp employees operating ground equipment.

It was just before XA:00 local time. I only had 2 aircraft on frequency and had not been on long. Traffic was not complex. The only abnormal issue with the traffic was the amount of Medevac aircraft that were in and out of ZZZ. I had an IFR Medevac asking for the RNAV Y approach to Runway XXL. I issued a proper crossing restriction for the fix pilots typically use for the approach. The pilot correctly read back the altitude; but did not stop at the issued altitude. I have great confidence in our Medevac pilots so I was not concerned that he might miss the altitude.A few minutes later; the Low Alt alarm went off. I issued proper low altitude phraseology and the pilot responded with 'correcting.' I then pointed out the airport and the pilot reported that he had the airport in sight. I then cleared him for a Visual Approach to Runway XXL. The pilot landed without incident. I decided to file this [report] to satisfy my need to report the issue and to protect myself. I made the decision NOT to issue pilot deviation phraseology and force this incident up to management. Our Medevac pilots are always extremely professional and do an amazing job getting medically critical passengers in and out of ZZZ quickly and safely. I had no desire to expound the issue and maybe take a good pilot who just made a mental error; out of the sky. I have no doubt that the pilot knew exactly what he had done wrong and I believe he will correct the issue. I have no recommendations for this. I issued a good altitude; and got a correct read back from the pilot. I'm sure the pilot was probably just tired and I have no doubt that he will correct this problem.",,,,"A TRACON Controller reported they received a Low Altitude Alert when an aircraft descended below a crossing restriction on an approach.",

As we turned westbound onto Taxiway ED; the Captain was taxiing at a very conservative taxi speed for the given conditions. These taxiways were contaminated with patchy snow/ice. Not quite at the halfway point; while westbound on ED; I reached up to start the APU and while doing this Ground Control instructed us to hold short of Runway 17R Approach. I had my 10-9 Taxi Diagram up with GPS location (not AMM). I immediately referenced the airport diagram and there were no markings at all on Taxiway ED displayed until just past Runway 17R which we weren't close to. I felt the Captain apply braking and he verbalized we were past it and braking was ineffective. ATC told us to 'Stop.' It wasn't until I looked at the AMM that I saw there was a hold line depicted with a *Spot 37* depicted right on it. Again nothing on the 10-9 page. Only on the AMM. Ground Control cleared us to the ramp uneventfully. Without a doubt; the buck stops with us. There are several things here worth noting that contributed to this situation. Although Runway 17R threshold hold line is painted on the taxiway on ED. East of Runway 17R; it is not depicted anywhere on the Jepp 10-9 Airport diagram. (It is depicted on the AMM; but there is also a big circle 37 on the marking on the AMM) In addition; there is no signage on either side of the taxiway.On this particular day; there was significant compacted snow on Taxiway Echo Delta (ED); which made it difficult to initially see the painted marking on Taxiway ED. After pulling into the gate; I pulled up the 10-9 to go over it again. There is a hotspot depicted at the threshold line on the west side of Runway 17R; with a note describing the hotspot and its potential to cross it; but nothing about the threshold on east side. Another factor in this situation was; although the Captain was going at a very conservative; appropriate speed; the instruction to hold short of the 17R threshold was given very shortly before we approached the threshold line while westbound on ED. Due to the patchy snow and ice; even though brakes were applied; the aircraft could not come to a stop in time. Like I said; at the beginning; without a doubt; the buck stops with us; but I just wanted to point out some conditions on this particular day and lack of the marking on the JEPP 10-9 which caused additive conditions on this particular day.",,"We landed on 17L. Upon clearing the runway; we were instructed to taxi via P; P7; ED; hold short of the Runway 17R Approach. As it was the day after a winter storm passed through DEN and the temperatures were still well below freezing; the taxiways were contaminated with patches of dry packed snow. We were taxiing at around 17 knots on ED. As we approached the hold short marking for the 17R Approach; Ground Control restated; 'Hold short of the 17R Approach. Right at that time I started braking to hold short. The aircraft was slow to decelerate so I applied more braking effort. Just short of the hold line the braking action went to NIL and the aircraft was not slowing down even with maximum braking effort applied. We ended up sliding through the hold short line and came to a stop about 1 aircraft length past the hold short markings. Right after we came to a stop Ground Control cleared us the rest of the way to the Gate via ED; L; CS. We reported the NIL braking on ED at the approach hold short to Ground Control via the Ramp Controller.Even though I was taxiing at a pretty slow speed it was still too fast for the unexpected NIL braking that was encountered. Taxiing even slower would have helped prevent this error.",,"Air Carrier flight crew reported that while taxiing on Taxiway ED; they crossed hold short lines approaching Runway 17R without clearance.

On our final approach; the Tower told us the previous landing aircraft reported the braking action to be good. On our landing roll; we also reported to breaking action to be good. However; minimal braking action was needed at this time because most of the runway turn-offs were closed. This meant we had to roll all the way to the end of the runway and use the final exit. The aircraft slowed down to about 15 kts. easily. As we approached the final exit; I applied harder braking to slow further and make the turn. The aircraft did not decelerate at all. I could feel the anti-skid system trying to gain control. I was also trying start a gentle right turn but the aircraft kept moving almost straight ahead. I determined that; at this rate of deceleration; the aircraft would run through the runway end lights so I applied max reverse thrust. The reverse thrust slowed us to about 5 kts. I was then able to continue the turn while stowing the thrust reversers and regaining braking control. The aircraft came within 10 feet of runway end lights before regaining control. I am writing this report because; per our company policies; use of maximum reverse thrust is prohibited at speeds below 75 kts. After turning off the runway; we asked Tower to amend our braking action report to medium to poor. After shutting down the aircraft; I informed one of our chief pilots about the incident.

My First Officer (FO) loaded the new approach in the FMS from ZZZZZ1 he fix where it ties into the STAR. This left us significantly high above the glide path so I selected green FLCH and full speed brakes. I also set the altitude selector to the FAF altitude of 3900 ft. at ZZZZZ2 since we had been cleared for the approach. My FO sent for standard / non-ice ACARS Runway XYR landing data and as he was loading the speeds in the FMS we received STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS EICAS message. At that point I became preoccupied with ensuring my FO resent for STALL PROT ICE SPEEDS and got them loaded in the FMS.I neglected to note that we were approaching the desired flight path at which point I should have selected VNAV on the Guidance Panel. Both my FO and I noticed we were beginning to descend below the path at the same time we received a low altitude alert from ATC.

I had to resend the request. We got the numbers and while cross checking with the Captain; we noticed we were descending below the flight path. Captain immediately disengaged his Autopilot and asked me to clear his Flight Director (FD); since we were already lined up for Runway XYR and he manually leveled off to arrest the descent and return to path. We had gone about 300 ft. below already by then. We continued the approach and landed without any issues. My failure to recognize that we were above glide path for XYR when I loaded the approach and we were close to the airport already.I could have suggested a go-around; at the least; but since I already had everything set up; I did not consider the level of saturation of the pilot in command (PIC) in the crosscheck of the numbers.

We acknowledged this message and then proceeded to load the RUMSY waypoint into the FMS.

We initially turned towards that waypoint but quickly realized that something was amiss. The RUMSY we entered was well past BOXER. We returned back to the FMS and tried to find the correct waypoint using a couple of different methods to type it in the FMS to identify the correct fix; but the only one in the FMS database was almost 6000 NM away. Meanwhile; ATC queried us as to our direction of flight and we told them that we were heading to RUMSY; but that it did not appear to be the correct fix. ATC then gave us a heading in the right direction. Meanwhile; we finally looked up and found the intended RUMSY fix on our Jeppesen app; only about 25 NM from our present position.

Engine run-up everything normalTakeoff Runway XX with a right turnout to the south following air-tractor in the pattern. The climb check completed during the transition climb from the runway environment to climb phase of flight. Utilizing Foreflight I put in a direct course from ZZZ to ZZZ1. The top of climb reached approximately 10 miles south of the airport at 5;500 feet. I trimmed for straight and level flight ran cruise checklist (leaned mixture; set cruise throttle 2400 rpm; landing lights off). Shortly after cruise checklist compete (roughly 5 minutes) I remembered C172H model quirk above 5;000 feet and switched to single tank (left). Not long after this (at this point I do not recall the time sequence of events) the engine sputtered. This was not uncommon for this to happen in these airplanes occasionally so I checked fuel selector and re-leaned the mixture in case I had the setting to lean. The engine smoothed out for a second then sputtered again; this time to a greatly reduced power setting. This time it was more alarming. I pushed the mixture in (full rich) and set the fuel selector to both; nothing changed. I applied full throttle and the engine came back a little for about 2-5 seconds and died off again. Still trouble shooting I referenced the checklist and saw nothing to be done as the engine was still running but not have any power. Once I reached about 3;000 feet I knew I did not have much time let so I started to circle a place to land and [requested priority handling] on 121.5 giving all information I could. I could still push the throttle out then in and gain a short boost of power but that was it. I knew I was going down and boosting the power a little was just going to put me out of reach of my landing location so I gave that up and prepared to land. I did not shut down per the checklist because I knew I had time and still wanted my radios and flaps available and the field ahead was an easy target. I executed a soft field landing with full flaps and came to a complete stop gently in a pasture. I then reported down and safe to a nearby pilot who was in contact with ATC. I noticed the engine was still running and I could bring it up to about 1500 rpms. I then shut down the airplane to exit and investigate the issue. After a quick post flight and oil check I could not determine the cause of the power loss. After talking with a nearby farmer I decided to better position the airplane in the field. The airplane started right up and seemed to have full power again so I position the airplane a little better in the field trough soft field taxi and secured the aircraft as best I could through applying parking brakes and control locks.Through further research I believe the aircraft could have experienced vapor lock in the engine. This could have been exacerbated by my use of the checklist in this situation.

Evaluating the situation and crosschecking instruments; I noticed unchanged airspeed; altitude; engine power. With the wobbler indicating an imminent stick pusher; I disarmed my stall pusher and prompted the First Officer (FO) to do the same. The FO was hand-flying the aircraft at that point; not deviating from the altitude. I also noted on my airspeed band high and low-speed Barber poles overlapping. I asked ATC for a block altitude. I then transferred the radios to my FO and ran the QRH for Stall Fail confirming the deselection of the Stall; Stick Pusher. The Stick Shaker contented with an occasional wobbler. The AutoPilot did not reengage. ATC accommodated our requests promptly. I elected to return back to ZZZ. I briefed the Flight Attendants (FA) on the situation and they briefed the passengers; with the note that later; workload permitting I will address the passengers again. Additionally I tried to contact Dispatch/Maintenance via AIRINC multiple times; to get guidance to immobilize the continuous stick-shaker. I also looked through the QRH again; not finding a procedure to immobilize the continuous stick-shaker. The AIRINC connection was garbled and unreadable. I tried to contact dispatch via ACARS to get a different AIRINC Frequency and possibly a circuit breaker location to disable the stick-shaker with no results. Dispatch sent a VOR frequency; a ZZZ Center frequency; and eventually the AIRINC frequency that we tried on the initial contact. Additionally I received multiple ACARS. ATC at some point asked; and I explained our situation. Since maneuvering of the aircraft and its performance as well as; all indications including airspeed were working; I did not request priority handling. My First Officer did an excellent job keeping the aircraft within altitude; airspeed and heading; even though we encountered moderate turbulence at some point. ATC accommodated all our requests and requesting priority handling at that point would have not changed the course of action that we were taking. I did keep in mind that the option of requesting priority handling is available if needed and would not hesitate to do so. I also briefed the passengers via the PA and communicated all necessary information to the Flight Attendants. At around 16;000 feet; the stick shaker stopped intermittently; with the occasional wobbler; and eventually subsided at around 8;000 feet. We landed without an incident.At the gate I deplaned the passengers; making additional PA's passing on information. After that I contacted maintenance to make a write up and explained the issue. Maintenance personal entered the aircraft during the call and I explained again in detail what the issue was. During deplaning and with maintenance onboard crew scheduling contacted me multiple times with schedule changes; even thought I indicated during the first conversation that I will call them back after completing this flight. After a self evaluation and looking back at the workload that we encountered I decided not to take an additional flight that day. At one of the calls from scheduling I asked to be connected to the Chief Pilot and discuss this with him. On a subsequent call I was connected to the Chief Pilot and after a short conversation was placed on hold for that day.After the flight I had discussions with other pilots and an instructor/pilot Training department. I reevaluated my decision to not request priority handling and came to the conclusion that; even though requesting priority handling would have not changed the outcome or workload in this situation; It would have been a better choice. In the future I will take this into consideration. During the flight I attempted to contact dispatch via frequency. The communication was garbled and unreadable. I ACARS dispatch and ask for an alternate AIRINC frequency. Dispatch sent multiple ATC Center frequencies and a VOR frequencies. The procedure for AIRINC should be reviewed with dispatch as well as the radio issues with AIRINC. To my knowledge there is no procedure in the QRH that addresses immobilizing an erroneous stick shaker; I tried to resolve this by involving a maintenance controller via AIRINC or ACARS with no results from dispatch. A standardization in abbreviated texts or phrases to use on ACARS between dispatch and pilots might have solved this. After the flight the workload was still high; deplaning; answering questions from passengers; making a maintenance write up and explaining to maintenance personal that come on board. During this time I received multiple calls. Some were from dispatch; which I felt were necessary; but also from crew scheduling which addressed schedule issues later in the day. On the initial call from scheduling I explained that I was busy and will call them back. I received multiple; additional calls from them; which became distracting.",,,,"CRJ-900 flight crew reported a malfunction with the Stall Warning system in cruise flight.",

After arriving at the FBO at ZZZ1; the Line Department advised me they would need to tow the plane to a different location. I then unpinned the NLG steering for towing. After repositioning the plane about an hour later; it was scheduled to be fueled. Fueling was delayed due to a plane that was parked next to our Westwind. Fueling was then further delayed because the Line Department didn't want to fuel us until after the newly parked plane departed first. Meanwhile I was contacted that our Passengers were on their way and would be there in ten minutes. For the second time I approached the FBO Attendant and asked to be fueled immediately. The Line Department department delayed getting to the fuel truck quickly so for a third time I approached the front desk and canceled the fuel request. At about that time my passengers showed up and we loaded the plane for departure. Taxing out to the runway (Runway XX) was normal. After departing the runway; I requested the Landing Gear Up; immediately after Gear Selection Up; I noticed a Red Unsafe Gear Light and Pitot Static Amber Lights Illuminated. This is consistent with the Nose Gear Steering Pin Not Installed. I had the Second In-Command (SIC) contact the FBO via UNICOM to verify if the Line Department Re-Installed the Nose Steering Pin after repositioning the plane. Their reply was; they did not re-install the pin. I made the decision to continue on to our destination of ZZZ where I as very familiar with the airport and they had adequate ARFF equipment. I advised ZZZ approach of our possible lack of the nose landing gear not being down and locked and the possibility of loss of steering control and requested priority handling. Upon selecting Gear Down; the indication showed all gear positions to be down and locked. I made a normal landing but held the nose gear off the runway as long as possible. When the nose tires finally contacted the runway; everything was initially normal. Then as the plane de-accelerated; the nose gear developed a light to moderate shutter; then quit. Post flight revealed that the nose gear steering pin was not installed. I have since initiated a procedure to guard both start switches in the cockpit with a red device until verification by both crew members of the nose pin installation can be made before removing the device.",,,,"Captain reported inadvertently leaving the nose landing gear steering pin uninstalled prior to takeoff.

On departure the aircraft failed to pressurize. We limited our climb to about 9000 ft. and told ATC that we were dealing with a pressurization issue. I elected to return to ZZZ2 and requested vectors to ZZZ2; rather than ZZZ due to the availability of a longer runways and the potential for better access to appropriate maintenance services.

MSL. Making proper radio calls for traffic avoidance the whole time while also maintaining visual scans for any other aircraft. I hear a call on the frequency while on midfield downwind 'ZZZ traffic; Aircraft Y entering midfield downwind for Runway XX'... as soon as I hear the radio call; I start to slightly panic as to figuring out where this airplane is located at that was coming out of nowhere making that one radio call. I look out to my right side right below me; and this plane is passing me up on the right side directly below me. (Would have been a catastrophic mid air collision had I been at 1300 ft.) He passes me up and continues flying straight while also flying past the field. This plane was at 1300 ft. MSL. I then make another radio call 'ZZZ traffic; Aircraft X on downwind for Runway XX fullstop'. The aircraft makes no other calls I continue flying the traffic pattern and was scanning every part of the traffic pattern for Aircraft Y while also making proper radio call outs; no sight. I land safely and clear the runway. My student and I decided to do one more lap for practice in the pattern since we don't see this hazardous aircraft anymore. We take off and had Aircraft Z following us safely in sync maintaining separation from each other the whole time. I turn crosswind and make my radio call; Aircraft Z decides to take off and follow (we're still looking around for Aircraft Y by the way). I call for downwind turn as turning downwind; Aircraft Z calls turning crosswind. 2 seconds later Aircraft Y calls turning crosswind right after Aircraft Z. I make another radio call stating that I'm established on the downwind for Runway XX full stop. I start my descent abeam my touch down point and when I start turning base at the 45 degree point from the runway. I call turning base on XX fullstop. Aircraft Z calls 'on downwind for 16 fullstop' and right after; Aircraft Y calls 'on downwind for Runway XX' Before I turn final I ask 'Aircraft Y; state your position?'. 'Aircraft Y on downwind for Runway XX'. I click back and state 'Aircraft X turning final for Runway XX number 1 fullstop'. 'Aircraft Z states on downwind turning base for Runway XX number 2 fullstop'. Right after; I hear 'Aircraft Y turning base for Runway XX'. with no sequential number followed by it. I land safely on the runway and cleared the runway and decided it was a good time to call it quits and get away from the aircraft that doesn't know how to maintain separation properly. 'Aircraft Z on final for Runway XX'. Right after; 'Aircraft Y on final; doing a go around to give you some room to clear the runway'.This occurrence was a lesson for my student and I to always be vigilant of uncontrolled airspaces and you can never be too vigilant. I wanted to make this report because I don't want this pilot flying without proper training or traffic avoidance. How to legally enter the traffic pattern at an uncontrolled airspace. Also would like to have that hazardous pilot receive proper medical attention with hearing and vision check from an Aviation Medical Examiner to constitute if he is safe to fly or not. I am blessed to make this report since if we were at any lower altitude I wouldn't be able to walk out of the airplane today and raise awareness to what could go wrong in an uncontrolled airspace. While all this was happening; the owner of the airplane I was flying decided to track the airplane on the traffic pattern and screenshot the Near Mid-Air collision between me and Aircraft Y with our altitudes and flight path. I would like to have it sent to whoever will be able to receive it. This airplane had 2 instances where the pilot had posed a hazard; possible mid-air collision to result in a catastrophic occurrence. And also runway incursion with Aircraft Z. All 3 of these airplanes that were in this situation didn't have an accident due to me and the other pilot in Aircraft Z maintaining positive communication on the radio.",,,,"Flight Instructor on training flight with student reported a NMAC with another aircraft in the airport traffic pattern.",

As the D-side; I was offline coordinating with surrounding sectors and facilities to get aircraft placed on a backup frequency. In addition to the frequency complication; at no time did an MSAW (Minimum Safe Altitude Warning) alert start flashing on the scope. Typically; this alert will flash minutes in advance giving plenty of time to correct the issue. In the Southwest area of ZAB; we have issues with our frequencies relatively often. Sector 42 has lost frequencies on multiple occasions. Other sectors have dead spots of radio coverage. For this to happen on a small busy Sector such as 46; it can be very dangerous.

I gave Aircraft X direct KONDE and had to descend Aircraft X to 2000 ft. to avoid VFR traffic opposite direction at 3000 ft. (not on my frequency). After that I cleared Aircraft X for the approach and issued traffic that was off his left that departed off a satellite airport (GIF). Then I called F11 to point out an aircraft who called for a pop up IFR off GIF and then issued the IFR to the other aircraft. Then I saw the traffic was passing behind Aircraft X at almost the same altitude and asked if they saw the traffic passing behind them. I thought it was the same traffic I had previously issued but then when I realized there was another aircraft out there; I apologized for not seeing the traffic sooner. The traffic that got close to Aircraft X was moving so quick I didn't not see the traffic as I was issuing the IFR to the other aircraft at the time. Aircraft X reported the traffic as a jet but never replied as to how close the traffic got. I later heard today that the pilot had called and is reporting it as a near midair.Recommendation: Possibly talk to local pilots that fly in/out this area. Develop alternate local recommended flight routes for VFRs to avoid traffic in and out of LAL.

As he was getting ready to make that turn; the towbar disconnected completely from the aircraft; but the crew was unaware of that until the Tug Driver gave me the instructions of; 'Captain; set parking brake.' This caught me off guard because the aircraft was still moving backwards and we thought the tug was still pushing us back. I questioned the Tug Driver and he again stated to set the parking brake.

After Maintenance was able to fix the issue we were pushed back a second time; all communication during the initial push back was standard and without issue; headsets were working and all communication was clear. During the push back we were told via headset clear to start engines; I replied starting engine 1. I continued to monitor outside while asking my First Officer (FO) to start engine #1. FO stated good start # 1. We were pushed back at an angle to the line and I was expecting to be pulled to the right to align us on the alley line; at this time two of the ramp crew walked away to the aircraft left and back to the gate. I saw the tug going to the right of the nose and the aircraft began to roll straight ahead. This immediately did not feel right and I asked if we were still connected. It was getting no immediate response I applied both pedal brakes and smoothly but quickly applied the parking brake. The aircraft stopped rolling and myself and the FO had a dialogue to verify that the tug had in fact been unhook and was pulling away without any verbal communication or signals. We were never told to set brakes and never told the ground crew they were clear to disconnect. Ground crew simply unhooked the tug and left. We rolled approximately less than 10 ft. I do believe had myself and my FO not been vigilant and situational aware this could have resulted in an accident or incident. I called ZZZ operations and notified them of what happened. They sent out the Supervisor who had done our push back and was told all was good on their end and that the airplane was clear to depart if we had no other issues; they also gave us a thumbs up signal. We continued on to our destination without further issues.",,"ZZZ ground crew with many trainees disconnected tug without communicating to flight deck to set parking brake - aircraft rolled forward until Captain applied parking brake. Out of gate at ZZZ; under night operations; we pushed back from the gate. The ramp was not well lit. During the pushback; the Captain; noticing the large number of orange vested trainees; out of an abundance of caution; wisely elected to hold off on starting the first engine until we were disconnected and all the personnel were clear of the aircraft (this info I present here just to establish that the number of trainees was significant enough to register as a concern by the Captain). During this disconnect; I personally noticed that it appeared there were multiple people being trained at the same time. Ground personnel disconnected; and we waited and even discussed the fact that one of the trainees was standing to the side still holding red X and no one had saluted and waved off. I saw that a trainer then instructed the trainee to drop the red X and salute; which they did; and the ground personnel departed. After the engine start; we experienced a problem with hydraulic SYS 2/Nose wheel steering and after a discussion with maintenance; it was decided we should return to the gate. We shut down #1 and waited for the ground crew to return and tug us back to the gate; which went normal. After maintenance came and trouble-shot the problem; we pushed back again. This time; when the ground crew said we were cleared to start number 1; we did so. The tug had pushed back and then pulled us forward at an angle to the taxi-out line. We stopped; still at a slight angle to the taxi-out line. After the engine start; I called up the hydraulic status page; and we were discussing the hydraulic indications when I had the sensation of acceleration forward and also noticed out of my peripheral vision that we appeared to be moving forward again. For a second I thought the tug had stopped and then was moving us again; but it definitely didn't feel 'right' - not like a normal tug movement. At that point we had not heard anything from the ground crew after we were cleared to start engines. Then I also noticed the tug moving away from the nose to the right. Again; it was very dark; but the thought was forming that the ground crew had disconnected us without communicating this or having the Captain set the parking brake. As my brain simultaneously decided to reach my feet forward and apply the brake pedals and say something to the Captain; Captain had come to the same conclusion and applied the parking brake; stopping us after we had moved approximately 10 or 15 ft. There were still ground personnel around the aircraft and the tug was at that time crossing back in front of us. If the Captain had not applied the parking brake when they did; I think it's a high likelihood that a serious incident could have occurred. Captain and I discussed what happened and we had gone through the same confusion of sensation - the mental disconnect of why it felt like the airplane was moving when as far as we knew it shouldn't be (kind of like the sensation one gets when the jet bridge moves away). The Captain then called operations and told them what had just happened so the ground crew could get some immediate feedback. After this; we proceeded with the flight as normal. I think this may have occurred is that there may have been too many inexperienced ground crew on the team and too much training going on at the same time; causing a generally chaotic feeling during the pushback; especially at night. Look at limitations on number of personnel being trained at any one time.",,"ERJ 175 flight crew reported the aircraft began to roll straight ahead  during push back.

They gave me a 12 minute hold time so another aircraft could get in first. After they landed I asked the pilots how the weather/approach/ and runway was; they told me it was 'better than what was reported' I called Center back and got my release. I lined up on the center line and applied full power. I got to roughly 45 kts. and started to drift off center-line to the left and could not regain directional control so I quickly aborted my take-off; applied the brakes and was able regain control of the plane and I was able to safely slow the airplane down and taxi off the runway at taxiway. The plane was not damaged and I did not go off the side of the runway. The airport manager; was waiting on the ramp in the snow plow.

We ended up verifying the wrong altimeter setting (I believe it was set at 30.35 when it was actually 29.35); which was the catalyst for the following events. I remember hearing from ATC that it was 30.35; and the Captain also said 30.35. We continue the flight as we normally would. ATC gave us a runway change to the visual Runway 27; also a descent via on the MHOMS1. I asked the Captain; to build the approach in the Multipurpose Control Display Unit (MCDU); get landing speeds; and brief the approach so that I could focus on flying the airplane. Captain backed up the visual approach with the RNAV Z 27. We run the runway change items and continue the flight. We leveled at 030 as assigned by ATC; and we were cleared for the approach; which caused me to arm the approach. We starting following the glide path down; and begin configuring the aircraft. As we began to descend; I looked at the altitude and started to figure that we were behind the aircraft due to remaining altitude (at this point the wrong altimeter setting is beginning to have its effects). We rushed to get the aircraft 'Stable' by 010. Some point between 030 and 010 I mention that we are very low for the distance. At around 007 I stay aloud; 'I think I am going to Go Around'. The Captain says something along the lines of; 'You need to level off'. Which I did by disconnecting the autopilot and hand flying. I leveled the plane and preceded to fly. While I was hand flying; the Captain searched for what caused the problem; which is when we discovered the altimeter was incorrect. I remained at that straight and level altitude until I intercepted with the PAPI; I then began a descent and landed the plane safely. I am not sure what the lowest altitude I saw was; but I do remember disconnecting the altitude at around 005; which is way too low for any margin of error. What would've kept me from having to file this report would be my suggestion of doing a Go Around. The company has an SOP for a reason; if I would've followed the company procedure and said Go Around as opposed to asking the Captain for basically permission to do a Go Around we wouldn't have been in the situation. The SOP states that any pilot at any time can issue a Go Around with no questions asked. I feel as if my hesitation not to call the Go Around is what caused this event. Also; to avoid the need of a go around all together; it should have been double checked with the altimeter setting.",,"While on the arrival to MCI level at FL 240. We had setup and planned for the arrival transition and visual for Runway 19L. When level at FL 240 Center assigned up a descent to FL 230 and to descend via the MHOMS1 arrival landing west. The First Officer set FL 230 into the altitude pre selector which both of us verified. I then began the process of programming the Multipurpose Control Display Unit (MCDU) for the west landing transition with the RNP Z 27 as a backup for the visual approach. While I was programming this change the First Officer entered 7000 as the bottom altitude. I caught the error explained that landing west had a bottom altitude of 4000. We both agreed and 4000 was set. In the meantime the aircraft had leveled at FL 230 and had flown well past the top of descent. The First Officer and myself discussed and got the proper descent angle set to ensure that we would meet the next crossing restriction of 12000 as MHOMS. I handed the radios off to the First Officer and I completed the descent announcement. When I finished the announcement I entered the local altimeter of 30.35; the First Officer entered 30.05 on their side. I noticed what I thought was the error on their side and we both set 30.35. Later I realized that the local altimeter was actually 29.35. We were given a descent to 3000 and the arrival was uneventful until we passed DMANN without any further guidance. When I queried ATC they asked if we had the field in sight which I did. We were given 170 or less until a 5 mile final and cleared for the approach. We joined the final approach course and I mentioned that they could use the RNP as a backup by just selecting APPR mode; which the First Officer decided to do. The aircraft was slowed and configured without incident until I noticed that not long after we intercepted the glide path the RA was showing 1200. The landing configuration was selected right at 1000 ft. on the RA and we continued the approach. The landing checklist was called for and completed. After completion of the checklist I looked up and we appeared low on the approach. At this time the First Officer mentioned that we appeared low. I told them they could level off and get back on the desired glide path. There were no obstacles showing on the terrain mapping on my Multi-function Flight Display (MFD). By the time my situational awareness caught up and I realized how low were actually were the VASI was coming in and we continued to a landing without further incident. I believe that using the RNP approach which showed us exactly on glide path in combination with the incorrect altimeter setting; no GPWS warnings; VMC conditions; and having the airport environment in sight at well over 10 miles out greatly delayed our realization as to how low on the intended vertical path to Runway 27 we actually were.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported descending to about 500 ft.

After going through the checklist I advised ATC on ZZZ Approach. Approach offered vectors to ZZZ2 and ZZZ3. I decided ZZZ2 was not an option due to open water. I decided ZZZ3 was not an option due to the lack of available landing options enroute to ZZZ3. I decided to land at ZZZ4 as it was the closest airport near me. I flew over the airport and spiraled down. Entered a downwind pattern and performed a landing with partial power. 15 minutes later I performed an engine run-up. The engine made full power.

At that time I and the instructor felt what seemed like our own wake from the previous turn. However; after setting the bank for the next turn I looked out the left pilot window and saw that the left wing tip had departed the aircraft. I immediately knocked off the training and rolled wings level while the instructor in the right seat contacted approach and got us a vector direct back to the airport. I flew a straight in approach with no further issues. The aircraft did not demonstrate any significant performance issues; the controls felt slightly heavier in right turns but nothing that was not controllable.

While enroute to ZZZ1; somewhere approximately 25 miles north of ZZZ4; I observed the NAV/COM 1 receiver to begin displaying a glideslope receiver error. I further observed the glideslope needle on CDI 1 rapidly going from full scale deflection up to full scale deflection down. This persisted for several minutes; despite turning the NAV/COM 1 off and then back on again. The NAV/COM 1 eventually turned off and was unable to be turned back on. Several minutes later I observed that the transponder had turned off and was unable to be turned back on. I checked the aircraft's analog ammeter gauge which appeared to still show a slight charge. With the slow onset of multiple failures of electrical equipment I began to suspect that this gauge was inaccurate. Shortly after losing the transponder the rest of the electrical gauges and equipment; including the second radio; became inoperative and were unable to be turned back on.Knowing now that I had experienced a complete electrical failure I shed the electrical load by turning off any remaining electrical equipment and resetting the generator circuit breaker on the circuit breaker panel. This did not correct the issue. Thinking that either the generator or voltage regulator on the aircraft had failed; I began looking for the nearest suitable airport to land at. It should be noted that I was still flying over rugged mountainous terrain with lower; mostly flat terrain; well ahead on my intended flight path. Weather had also accumulated to my south with what appeared to be visible precipitation. Knowing that the ambient air temperature was conducive to icing conditions; and I would be unable to navigate in IMC; I knew that the number one objective was to remain in VMC. I continued using my EFB app on my iPad to try and find the nearest airport that appeared to be in VMC conditions. My preference would be on airports that were outside of mountainous terrain that allowed for a smooth and predictable VFR approach to landing. A controlled field with emergency services and snow removal equipment was also preferrable as the entire region had been blanketed in snow in the days and weeks prior to my flight.During my search I sent a text message to another rated Commercial Pilot that was monitoring my flight and asked them to look for a suitable landing alternate. I informed them that I had experienced an electrical failure and would need to land. This pilot evaluated the options along my route and notified me that ZZZ appeared to be the best option as they were reporting the most favorable wind; visibility; ceiling; and runway conditions. I proceeded past several other airports on my way to ZZZ that did not favor a VFR approach to landing at the time of my flight and continued on to ZZZ. As I approached ZZZ airspace I used my handheld transceiver to contact ZZZ Approach. ZZZ TRACON had been notified of my situation and were expecting my arrival. They began giving me instructions to enter the Class D airspace and set up for a right base entry to Runway XX. ZZZ Approach then handed me off to ZZZ Tower. I explained to ZZZ Tower that I was not requesting priority handling as my landing gear and all other necessary equipment was still operational. I further explained to them that I was on a handheld radio and that the aircraft radios; lights; and transponder were not operational. ZZZ Tower cleared me to land and I landed without incident. After landing I gave my information to the emergency ground personnel that responded to the scene at their request. The plane was then service by a local avionics shop and it was eventually determined that the aircraft's generator had failed at some point in the flight. Upon reviewing the flight I evaluated other options that I might have had in regards to landing alternates. With the large amount of mountainous terrain in the area; the worsening weather conditions; and the knowledgethat the weather and terrain improved the further I flew east; I feel that ZZZ was indeed the most suitable and safest alternate landing site available to me at the time. While I think I might have made the same decision on my own; I was not set on choosing ZZZ until I had received a message from my fellow pilot on the ground. Along with communicating via cell phone with another pilot during this urgent situation; further contributing to the safe outcome was my possession and use of a handheld transceiver unit. With this handheld radio I was able to communicate with the ZZZ TRACON and land at the most suitable airport I had available to me at the time.",,,,"Cessna 210 Pilot reported a complete electrical failure and a diversion to the nearest suitable airport for landing.",

Tower cleared us to land and notified us of a pair of Military helicopters east of the final approach course performing maneuvers. Tower also said that they should remain to the east of the final approach course. I told Tower we were looking and continued the approach. Neither of the helicopters showed up on our TCAS. The Captain was the first to see the helicopters and told me where they were. I finally saw them and reported them insight to Tower as he had told us where they were again. Tower said they should stay over to the east. We continued the approach. Probably around our 1000 [ft.] call; we noticed one of the helicopters had started to climb and was heading towards the final approach corridor for [Runway] XX which we were on. We both noted it and both expected the helicopter to start a turn east bound. Instead; the helicopter continued straight on a course that would have put him on a collision course with us; my guess is around 300 [ft.] MSL. Very shortly afterward; we were at about 500 [ft.] when the Captain called for the go-around as I had started to say it as well. We executed the go-around. I lost sight of the helicopter as we pitched up; but the Captain told me it never changed course and flew directly beneath us. We executed the missed approach and circled back around for a visual approach; which was successful and taxied to the gate with no further incidents. We told both Tower and Approach what happened and the Captain called it in to the Company Operations Center once we were parked at the gate. We never had the helicopter on TCAS and never received a TA or RA.

Aircraft X was vectored to join the ZZZ radial for the VOR approach and instructed to maintain 3000 ft. Their altitude at the time was 4000 ft. The phraseology was issued incorrectly as the trainee said 'Aircraft X 15 miles from ZZZ VOR turn right heading 290 maintain 3000 cleared VOR approach' leaving out until established on the approach. I discussed this issue briefly with the trainee as we were working a 3 plane sequence to intersecting arrival path runways and Aircraft X was number three. Instructions needed to be issued to other aircraft; but I should have made a point to have the phraseology corrected on frequency. During my scan I saw Aircraft X join the ZZZ radial about 14 miles from the VOR for the VOR approach at which point they could descend to 2500 ft. until 10 miles from the VOR where they can descend to 1800 ft. According to our function this is just inside of the depicted obstacle in a 2400 ft. MVA under the approach path. As Aircraft X began descending I noticed they were coming down quickly and told the trainee to pay attention to them. As Aircraft X crossed the obstacle they descended 2400 ft. to 2200 ft. pretty quickly at which point I told the trainee to issue a low altitude alert; which unfortunately was issued incorrectly leaving out the LOW ALTITUDE ALERT phraseology. I didn't correct the phraseology as Aircraft X was now inside of what the function showed to be 10 miles from the VOR and was legal to descend to 1800 ft. So; I had the trainee tell Aircraft X to descend via the approach. A brasher was issued for a possible pilot deviation. During the tape talk I had with my Front Line Manager (FLM) yesterday; I was advised that the management believed this was a significant loss with terrain on me the Controller and was advised to file a report. I am not sure how accurate the function on STARS is compared to the DME readout on aircraft; so this may not have been an MVA bust or a pilot deviation. However; there is no marker on my radar map that tells me exactly where 10 DME is from the VOR on that approach. I recommend a map update to reflect that so that we can avoid issuing erroneous low altitude alerts. Also; the approach plate's REMAIN WITHIN 10NM has always been open for interpretation as to whether it is 10NM from the VOR or the airport. I recommend clarity of this distinction on the approach plate.",,,,"TRACON Controller reported an aircraft cleared for an approach descended below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.

Ground Control instructed taxi to Runway XXL for departure and gave us a wheels up time of +15 min. We were then switched to Tower frequency with Aircraft Y holding short of Runway XXL full length and us as Aircraft X. Tower asked us to pull into the hold block for XXL to allow Aircraft Z behind us to access the runway via intersection Taxiway 1. Tower then gave Aircraft Z take off clearance from intersection Taxiway 1 but denied back taxi for full length. Aircraft Z then declined the takeoff clearance and informed Tower they would need to reload data and perform a checklist. After landing traffic on XXL; Tower asked Aircraft Z if they could move to give us access to the Runway via Taxiway 1; so we could make our wheels up time. Aircraft Y had a later wheels up time and was still holding short full length XXL. Aircraft Z was cleared to taxi down Runway XXL and clear Taxiway 2 back onto Taxiway 3. We were instructed to hold short of Runway XXL at Taxiway 1. I chose to hold our position in the hold block while we dealt with the additive condition of task loading with a runway change. Tower asked if we could take Taxiway 1. We replied on the radio that we needed a minute to load new data and run a checklist. Tower responded that we had 50 seconds to make our wheels up time or we would need a new wheels up time. I responded to please get us a new wheels up time. Traffic permitting; Tower then cleared Aircraft Y and Aircraft Z for departure; leaving us as the only aircraft in the holding block. Tower informed us of our new wheels up time. We asked Tower if we should now expect a full length departure from XXL to which they replied; 'Stand by.' Approximately five minutes passed with no response from Tower on departure point. Approaching our new wheels up time; Tower instructed us to taxi up to and hold short of Runway XXL full length. With the intersection data loaded; I told Tower that each time they change our departure point; we need to load new data and run a checklist. Tower changed out taxi instructions to taxi up to and hold short of Runway XXL at Taxiway 1. As we taxied; the First Officer had deleted our data; when our clearance was for full length; but then reloaded when our taxi instructions changed to the intersection of Taxiway 1. As we approached XXL at Taxiway 1; Tower issued what we thought was position and hold on Runway XXL at Taxiway 1. With the additive conditions of task loading to accomplish the Before Take Off Checklist and the operational pressure to make our wheels up time along with meeting minimum fuel requirements for the flight; I was getting behind and did not hear Towers second clearance. I believe both the First Officers and I's expectation bias led us to believe that a second instruction from Tower would be a line up and wait. I did rely on my First Officers response to the call; which was line up and wait XXL at Taxiway 1. Tower did not catch our error nor make any correction. As I entered the runway at Taxiway 1; I cleared final and saw company aircraft at 800 ft on final approach. I thought it was tight but it fit into my expectation bias that Tower was trying to make our wheels up time since they had emphasized our first wheels up time. As I lined up on centerline for Runway XXL; I expected a takeoff clearance but none was received. After an awkward silence and glancing at the TCAS display and now seeing company at 600 ft on final I got the sinking feeling that there may have been a miscommunication. The next radio call was Tower instructing company to go around. Tower then asked us to copy down a phone number for possible pilot deviation. I think several things led to this communication error and runway incursion. I think the Tower Controller could understand the task loading created with multiple runway changes for intersection departures. Our error was allowing additive conditions to put us behind as a crew and then letting our expectation bias for makingour wheels up time. This resulted in the communication error of reading back the wrong clearance. In the future I will not allow myself to take the runway if I feel behind for any reason regardless of a wheels up time.",,"While taxiing to Runway XXL for departure; Tower informed us of a flow time to ZZZ1 and instructed us to pull into the hold pad. There was an aircraft holding short of the runway at Taxiway 4 intersection for the full length. As our flow time approached; Tower told us that we would have to depart from Taxiway 1 intersection; and that we would not be able to back taxi. At this time we informed Tower that we would have to re-run our performance numbers and it would take a few minutes. Tower responded that they would have to get a new flow time for us; which we said was OK.After we had new performance numbers for the Taxiway 1 intersection departure; we let Tower know and received a new flow time. While we were waiting for our new flow time; the aircraft that was on Taxiway 4 for the full length departed. We asked which intersection we could plan on departing from; since we would have to re-run our numbers again for full length. Tower told us to standby; but never answered our question. As our new flow time approached; Tower told us to taxi to the full length intersection at Taxiway 4; at which time we informed them that we would have to change our performance numbers again. As we were in the process of changing our performance numbers; Tower instructed us to hold short of the runway at the Taxiway 1 intersection. It was during this time of high workload; while undoing the changes we had begun to make so we could meet our flow time; that we mistook Tower's instruction for a lineup and wait clearance. When reading back the instructions; we read back 'Runway XXL at Taxiway 1 lineup and wait;' and did not get any response or challenge from Tower. After lining up on the runway at Taxiway 1; we expected immediate takeoff clearance as there was an aircraft on final; but the clearance didn't come and the landing aircraft was instructed to go around. Once that aircraft was clear we were informed of the possible pilot deviation. We were then given takeoff clearance. If we had gotten earlier communications from Tower about the sequence of aircraft and the need for an intersection departure; we could've avoided the additive conditions that led us to be behind. If Tower had answered our question of what takeoff point we could expect for our new sequence we could've re-programmed our performance numbers while we were waiting; and we wouldn't have been task loaded at the last minute approaching our flow time. If we had told Tower we could only accept a Taxiway 1 intersection departure; when Tower instructed us to taxi for the full length; we could have avoided another last second change; which led to us being task loaded and miss hearing the second taxi instruction from Tower. If Tower had clarified our clearance after we read back XXL at Taxiway 1 lineup and wait we wouldn't have deviated from the initial instructions we were given.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a communication breakdown between flight crew and ATC which resulted in a critical ground conflict.",

All three altimeters were set correctly to 30.03' and all altimeters were in agreement while behaving consistent with expectations.

I scanned across all three altimeters attempting to verify their integrity and asked my First Officer (FO)/pilot monitoring (PM) to request an altimeter setting from ATC as well as to request what they showed as our current altitude. ATC confirmed that our altimeters were accurate at 30.03' and that our altitude (now passing 3900 ft. in a descent) agreed with what we were showing. We also checked the Descent Page of our FMC's and confirmed the altimeter setting I had programmed prior to commencing our initial descent out of cruise was 30.04'; clearly not being responsible for this RAAS advisory.

I observed the fuel quantity indicator for a couple of minutes and observed that the left wing fuel quantity was decreasing by 10 lbs every 1-2 seconds. I then asked our flight maintenance technician to do a visual inspection of the wing for fuel. He returned and reported that there was indeed significant fuel leaking from the engine pylon and upper wing surface. I went to look for myself and confirmed that there was a significant amount of fuel pouring from the upper surface of the engine pylon; an inspection panel just aft of the pylon; and from several seams in the upper wing also aft of the pylon. I returned to my duty station; contacted dispatch via Satcom; advised that we needed to make a precautionary landing. We agreed that ZZZ was best option. We ran the engine fuel leak QRH procedure; which necessitated a precautionary engine shut down and diversion. I advised ATC of the situation. We performed a single engine approach and landing at ZZZ. By the time we landed the amount of fuel lost was 1800 lbs from the left wing. I understand that a main fuel pump on that side had recently been replaced. Was a seal or sealant overlooked?

We could see a plane on runway and tried to get clearance; but lots of chatter. Tower cleared aircraft for take-off; and cleared us to land; as we were on short final. There was no way the departing aircraft could be off runway in time; so we went missed approach. My First Officer (FO) reported to Tower we were going missed; and Tower told us 'Climb 4000 and turn right heading 270; no! LEFT LEFT heading 270!' Which we did. As we did our missed approach; we got a TA from right; and it turned into an RA. Tower said Aircraft X; turn right; NO! LEFT to a heading'.

I asked how long this vector would be; they said not long. I said to them: 'That was a total catastrophe back there!' Where they replied; 'I agree'.

I informed Tower of our go around and they said 'Roger; climb to 4000 and turn right heading 270. No; left; left turn 270.' We made the turn and I saw the aircraft climbing underneath us as we turn and we got a TA saying 'traffic traffic'. Shortly after that Tower said 'Aircraft X turn right heading 240. Wait; left; left turn heading 240.' At that point we had gotten an RA from the aircraft and were complying with that. I informed Tower that we were complying with the RA and they responded 'roger; contact Approach on (I don't remember the frequency).' My Captain took the radios as I made a passenger announcement.

At approximates FL227; we encountered an Excessive Aircraft Vibration event. We requested a level off with ATC and began to troubleshoot.The F/CTL page displayed no control surface fluttering so we moved onto the Engine page. We noted that Engine 2 in comparison to Engine 1 had a much higher level of Engine Vibration. The indication was not amber or red and its reading was 2.1-2.4 which; honestly; is a not an uncommon reading.I suggest to the First Officer (FO) who was acting as PF (pilot flying) to reduce the #2 Thrust Lever to idle. Once the engine speed was reduced the vibration ceased. I then suggested to the FO that he try to slowly increase the TL (thrust lever) back towards the climb detent. He was unable to make it more than halfway to the CL detent and the vibration returned. So; we elected to leave the #2 Engine at idle. We choose not to shut down the #2 Engine as we were still able to utilize the Engine Driven Generator; the Yellow Hydraulic Engine Driven Pump and the #2 Engine Bleed Air System; not to mention should we need the engine; although we would have expected vibration; at least we would have had it available. We also decided to start the APU and utilize the APU Bleed Air; below 10;000 ft.; this way if we had to go around; we would have max thrust for the go-around as we had planned to only utilize the #1 Engine for the go-around should we need to perform one.For your timing most of what happened in the prior paragraph was most likely less than a few minutes of discussion. We were still level at about FL230; the Flight Attendants were calling in a mild state of panic regarding the vibrations and I told them to Standby.We divided duties at this point. I had the FO [request priority handling] and request vectors back to ZZZ and prepare the FMGC for a return to field.I contacted Dispatch to advise of the return to field and the nature of the mechanical abnormality. The Crew Phone was not able to function properly; which in hindsight I felt like I wasted a bit too much time focusing on trying to make a call to the Dispatcher rather than just using the ACARS. I advised the Flight Attendants of a precautionary landing; to include a brief description of the situation and to reassure them that we had total control over the aircraft. I told them that we had about 20-30 minutes to land. After speaking with the Flight Attendants; I made a general announcement to the Passengers essentially detailing that the aircraft was fine and as a precaution we were returning to ZZZ to have our maintenance team inspect for any issues.By the time I returned to rejoin with the FO we were now about at 11;000 ft. and about 30 miles from ZZZ. He briefed me on the state of the flight and we went through the overweight landing QRH procedures and performed the landing assessment. We didn't utilize the non-normal landing checklist in the OD pages of the QRH. Passing 10;000 ft. we gave the Flight Attendants prepare for landing PA and the sterile chime. Almost simultaneously; and just as we were about to conduct the descent checklist; we got an AIR ENG 1 Bleed Fault ECAM; which again; in hindsight; most likely correlated with my turning on the APU Bleed. We asked for extended vectors to accomplish this additional ECAM procedure.Once the ECAM actions were completed and we ensured no critical follow up items were to be performed; (it appeared there was only the possibility of a computer reset so we elected to forego that procure.) We briefed the visual approach to XXR; which was a requested ATC runway change; and conducted the descent checklist.From here on it was an uneventful approach and landing albeit overweight. The FO did have to use manual thrust control because we didn't have the #2 Engine Shutdown and so Auto Thrust wasn't available. And actually; now that I think about it; after our initial level off at 11;000 ft.; our speed did get quite slow for a moment; never below Vls but headed that was in a hurry. I'm not sure if the FO momentarily forgot that auto thrust wasn't on anymore or was just a bit too slow to introduce thrust to arrest the speed decay but as the Autopilot began to level off; we began to slow quite rapidly. I prompted him to add power almost exactly as he was already doing it. After that there were no more slow speed issues as we were both acutely aware of the manual thrust situation. We flew in for the visual approach to Runway XXR in ZZZ. We had Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) standing by and after landing we stopped on the runway for a visual inspection and a thermal reading of the brakes. After ARFF responded that they saw nothing abnormal and I felt we had positive control of the aircraft on the ground for taxi operations; I elected to taxi the aircraft to the gate with ARFF following.Once at the gate we had the Passengers remain seated just until we had a game plan from Maintenance and operations and in less than five minutes the Passengers were instructed to deplane as the aircraft was taken out of service. While deplaning Maintenance was hovering in the flight deck doorway asking lots of questions it was a bit unnerving as both my FO and I were really starting to feel the effects of the adrenaline rush starting to fade. Anyway; I made three logbook entries. 1. Regarding the Vibration which I tried to convey that the Vibration was the complete aircraft vibrating and that the Vibration was only resolved by reducing the power on the Number 2 Engine. 2. I wrote up the ECAM for the AIR ENG 1 Bleed Fault. 3. I wrote up the overweight landing and noted that it was a smooth touchdown.Once that was done I received a Dispatch message via ACARS asking me to call. I called and we just discussed in cursory detail what had happened.Next the Chief Pilot Name called and asked if the FO and I were okay and that she was going to pull us off our sequence to get a chance to unwind.Lastly; and I wish it was firstly; I had a chance to say goodbye to the remaining Passengers and apologize for the delay to their travel; but most importantly I was able to make sure that the Flight Attendants were okay. I also discussed with them how they felt the situation went. They liked that when they initially called; I told them to 'Standby'. They explained to me that just hearing 'Standby' gave them peace that at least we knew something was wrong and that we were most likely trying to solve it. I can only imagine that they would be fearful of their calls not being answered at all. Secondly they explained that when I called them back to advise them of a precautionary landing that I also advised them that we had complete control of the aircraft.As I don't know how the vibration propagated I have no answer as to what may have caused the vibration.I only have some hind sight suggestion regarding a vibration event. I'm sitting here in front of my PC nearly 24 hours from the incident. I've been watching the electronic logbook to see what the corrective action take is because I'd like to know more about the why this happened. I want to make sure I could have avoided this situation in the first place. Sadly the aircraft was signed off as 'checked vibration within limits'. Since its sign off the aircraft has been refused by two crews already.My point for a corrective action may be in how we record in the logbook and engine vibration vs an airframe vibration. At a minimum this airplane should have been test flown prior to return to service. So to simplify my long winded answer to this important question. Have a method of reporting vibration that triggers a test flight prior to return to service or require any vibration to be test flown prior to return to service.",,,,"A321 Captain reported Number 2 Engine Vibration in climb.

We took off Runway XXR and experienced an engine failure at 80 feet or so after rotation. The very moment this occurred; I instructed the pilot: power idle; land. He fought with me on the controls; but ultimately I finally got him to go power idle and land. We had about 200 to 300 feet left of runway before going off into the grass. Which I did not care about; we were on the ground and not going to hurt anyone else. He loses his nerve and goes full power; taking back off again. So the fight began again for the best course of action; since he lost his nerve and took back off again. Ultimately through a series of losing and regaining the engine I was able to instruct him over to Runway XYR; the north parallel and landed with clearance from tower. No injuries or damage was sustained. He informed me the plane just came out of an oil change from his mechanic. I think more strict training and situational awareness should be made in the event of an after engine takeoff failure and adhering to our plan for an engine failure after rotation. I could see in his mind; landing back on the runway didn't seem like an option because he was afraid of the grass. This fear of overrunning the runway was what lead him to this terrible decision to continue around.",,,,"Flight Instructor reported a loss of engine power at 80 feet after rotation.

In the right seat my passenger is an IFR rated pilot who has several thousand hours. Approach on XXX.XX cleared me on the GPS XX approach at an altitude of 2000 to the IAF of ZZZZZ while on the segment from there to the IF of ZZZZZ1 at an airspeed of 120 kts. Approach called out traffic to my east which my Garmin G500 TXI; GTN 650 and screen showed at 1300 ft. below us. My passenger and I looked to the east could see nothing until within a few seconds the Garmin Traffic alarms when off and a light twin jet flew about 50 ft. under us; I could see the pilot in the front seat! No evasive action would have been possible in the time I had. As I continued the approach the Controller apologized for what happened and turned me over to ZZZ. Later that day I reviewed our flight on ADS-B found that at XA:19 at our altitude there was a jet traveling at 275 MPH on a heading of 265 degrees than one minute later 350 degrees leveling off at 2900 ft. and 252 MPH. The aircraft continued orbit in the ZZZ1 area.ZZZ1 does have a clearance delivery and the ZZZ Approach frequency for that airport is the same one that I was on. My fellow pilot and I never heard Approach talking to the jet. From ADS-B it appears that the jet took off from ZZZ1 on a heading of 226 then turned right almost perpendicular to our flight path. They came in a blind spot blocked by our wing. I have the latest Garmin Traffic System in my ADS B system in my Beechcraft. The ZZZ airport was very busy as evidenced by the Tower told me I was sixth to land when I checked in after the hand off from ZZZ Approach. If I had been at the altitude prescribed on the Runway XX approach plate I would have been at 2700 ft; it still would have been close but not fifty ft. On a telephone call with Approach Control after the incident they told me the minimum vectoring altitude on this segment was 1600 ft. ZZZ1 is located close to class B airspace. Something needs to be done to protect the airspace between ZZZ1 and ZZZ. With the large cargo jets and other fast traffic at ZZZ I am very concerned about the overlap in traffic between the two airports.",,,,"Beechcraft pilot reported a NMAC while on a GPS approach.

With aggressive braking; the airplane slid off the right side of the runway. Once it hit the wet grass; it carried on sliding till it hit the berm on the right side of the runway below the fence.

The diamond was pegged on 'F'. The speed bug remained on the commanded cruise speed .of 80 Mach and never moved. 'Flap Limit' was displayed in amber on the Attitude Indicator. The flap indicator showed the flaps retracted in their the commanded position and the flap handle was fully in the up detent. The auto throttle subsequently began reducing the power smoothly to idle. As I had been watching this unfold and noticed the thrust reduction; I instructed the Pilot Flying (PF) to address the power state. He immediately manually stopped the throttles before they reached idle. The Throttles were then manually pushed up; but the autothrottles resisted and the PF disconnected it. Even with immediately recognizing this insidious; silent event that if unnoticed could lead to a high altitude aircraft stall over the featureless ocean on a moonless night; 10-15 knots were lost and the subsequently recovered. We contacted Maintenance and our Dispatcher on a satellite call. A subsequent sat call included the duty pilot and an Engineer to determine what was occurring and whether a return to ZZZ was needed. After discussing this as a team; the First Officer and I decided to continue as long as the event did not reoccur or there were no other system or electrical anomaly's that surfaced. None of us had experienced this before. It appeared to me that the event initiated with the aircraft systems determining the flaps were out of up at cruise followed by the autothrottles reducing power below the command bug speed to protect the flaps.

I looked myself and there was ice on front and back of fan blades with icicles on front of #2 Engine fan blades. Coordinated with local contract ground operations to use ground air to deice engine fan blades. Process was very slow and ground crew and flight crew had never used the procedure before. I inspected the progress multiple times and spun each engine fan blade and checked they were clear front and back. We discussed that we would do an engine run up on the runway to check for any abnormal engine indications prior to take-off. It began snowing; and we performed two-step deicing. We took the runway; performed engine run up in accordance with deice/anti-ice card; noted normal indications and began the take-off roll. Around 100 kts; I felt a vibration from the #2 Engine Thrust Lever and noted the Vibration Gauge indicated 2.1. Vibration trended down after liftoff and was even with # 1 Engine; approximately 0.5 Units. Encountered moderate rime icing around 3000 ft. At 5000 ft. we performed a gradual power increase from (climb) CLB-2; to CLB-1; to full climb thrust. When we selected CLB-1 vibration increased from 0.5 to 0.9. When we selected full climb thrust; Engine Vibration Gauge increased to approximately 4.2 Units with Flashing White Box around the Secondary Engine Indications; and Vibration felt in # 2 Thrust Lever. Called for engine high vibration checklist; but prior to starting the checklist the engine vibration had returned to normal after 20-30 seconds of exceeding 4.0 Units.

The previous day this aircraft was written up by the Captain of FLT XXXX for #2 engine vibration at 22700 ft. after take-off. The flight returned to ZZZ because the only way to stop the vibration was to run the #2 engine at idle power; effectively making it single engine at that time. Due to the aircraft loading; an overweight landing was also written up. Maintenance performed an engine vibration survey and signed off as vibration within acceptable limits. I did not feel comfortable accepting this aircraft without being test flown first; especially down to ZZZZ in mountainous terrain.

Better oversight on tracking aircraft that had just suffered engine problems to have returned to field from FL230; maybe in Maintenance or Dispatch; not sending them out without recreating the scenario with test pilots; instead of putting line pilots and passengers in that role.

We were cleared to Runway XX via Taxiway XX on the Ground Control frequency note 10-9 Jepp chart. As we were approaching [Taxiway] XY we contacted the Tower and advised the controller that we would be ready for departure at the end of Runway XX. The Tower acknowledged us but made no mention of us being number two for takeoff. Unbeknownst to us there was a single engine Cessna preceding us to Runway XX as well. We did not hear any radio transmission or see any other aircraft on the way to Runway XX. Just past [Taxiway] XY in the farthest reach of our taxi light beam was the Cessna holding short of the hold lines for the approach end of Runway XY. I suddenly and aggressively applied the brakes and came to a stop very close to rear ending the Cessna. The Tower had no awareness that the Cessna had stopped on Taxiway XX at that point instead of holding short of Runway XX at its hold lines. Directly in front of us the Cessna made a narrow profile and the area we were taxiing in was very dark. Runway XY was not open and aircraft using Runway XX are expected to round the corner at the end of Taxiway XX and hold short of [Runway] XX perpendicular to the runway. The Cessna may have been confused; and the Tower may have lost situational awareness of the Cessna's position and may not have been aware that the pilot stopped on [Taxiway] XX.Cause: poor situational awareness by ATC and lack of good communication. Also; lack of situational awareness and airport layout familiarity by the preceding aircraft.Suggestions: better communication by ATC.

Almost immediately saw the emergency lights turn on and received an emergency call from the forward Flight Attendant. I called for controls and radios and immediately suspected that the main cabin door seal was faulty leading to a loss of pressure. I realized that the cabin altitude emergency decent would not be necessary in this scenario due to our low altitude; and not seeing any additional messages; we searched the QRH; and did not find anything. I was not sure of exactly which QRH procedure to run at this point so I elected to have the First Officer call back to the Flight Attendant to try to better understand the gravity of the situation but unfortunately the noise from the door seal was so loud he was unable to hear anything. I told ATC that we would be leveling off at our pre-assigned altitude of 8000 ft.; that we had lost pressurization and that we would need to return to ZZZ. We received vectors while we ran some checklists. The First Officer was looking for an appropriate checklist while I flew the aircraft and communicated with ATC. Eventually we settled on the unpressurized flight procedure message. In hindsight this may not have been 100 percent correct but I determined that it was the most appropriate under the circumstances and would hopefully prevent landing with an improper pressurization condition should the seal become intact and the cabin suddenly pressurize again. We completed the procedure which alleviated the noise from the door seal and we were finally able to communicate with our cabin crew at which point I relayed the company items; while the First Officer began setting up for the ILS to XXL. At this time I also made a PA announcement explaining that we had suffered a malfunction and would be returning to ZZZ. I briefed the approach and we realized that we would be close to our max landing weight. At this point I elected to configure the aircraft early to increase our fuel burn. We completed a descent checklist; and advised ATC that we were ready to return for landing. Now that things had calmed down somewhat I made one final call to the Flight Attendants to reiterate that there was no need to brace and no plan for evacuation. We landed approximately 300 lbs. overweight at a rate of approximately 200 fpm at touchdown. We cleared the runway; and taxied to the gate without further incident. I was very impressed with the professionalism and performance of my crew.I feel that the startle factor combined with adrenaline may have caused me to overestimate the severity of the situation. I feel that in hindsight we could have easily asked for a momentary delay vector to avoid the overweight landing. I also feel that the selection of emergency depressurization per the QRH was not necessary; and that a manual depressurization using the cabin pressure controller would have been a less drastic way to vent the remaining pressure from the cabin.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported a cabin depressurization due to a faulty main door seal.

The other flight; I believe; was another company [CRJ]-900. We were given instructions by ATC to descend and maintain 11;000 ft. The other aircraft was in its climb to cruise. ATC had warned both aircraft of each other and told them to maintain visual separation. My Captain had been the one to acquire visual separation because the other aircraft was at our low 10 - 11 o'clock and out of my sight range. About 200 ft. before we leveled off I saw my Captain bring the throttles to idle; shallow the descent massively; and deploy the speed brakes in order to get behind the aircraft as he determined we may cross flight paths. As the other aircraft disappeared from his line of sight we got our first TCAS RA. It was a level off RA and we immediately began to follow. Seconds later it changed to a climb RA that peaked at +4;000 ft. per minute. We again proceeded to follow it and once it was resolved; returned to our assigned altitude and informed ATC.The other crew failed to maintain visual and situational awareness. This resulted in them climbing into us and causing the TCAS RA. Pilot should have maintained adequate visual contact and separation. They should have also not begun a climb in speed mode till they were well clear of us; the passing traffic overhead.",,"While descending into ZZZ; we were cleared to descend to 11;000 ft in preparation for landing. At around 15;000 ft; ATC pointed out another aircraft at our 10 - 11 o' clock at 5 miles; climbing below us to 10;000 ft. As pilot flying; I saw the aircraft and told the FO (First Officer) to report we had the traffic in sight; and slowed our descent as to not have a closure rate RA on him. When the traffic reported us in sight; ATC instructed him to 'maintain visual separation' with us; and to climb to FL230. Upon hearing this; I deployed the spoilers as to stay behind him; in case he decided to climb quickly. At 11;400 ft; I lost sight of him as he was under our nose; and immediately got a TCAS TA on him. In response I slowed our descent rate to 200 FPM vertical speed. Immediately after this; I got a 'LEVEL OFF' RA; which I complied with immediately; disconnecting the autopilot. One second later; we got a 'CLIMB CLIMB' RA; with the aircraft requiring at least 3;000 FPM climb rate to comply with the RA. I immediately set climb thrust; stowed the spoilers; and complied with the RA; while the FO reported the RA to ATC. At 13;000 ft; we got a 'maintain vertical speed' resolution; and I pitched over to maintain the required 500 FPM climb rate; after slowing to 230 KIAS. Once receiving the 'clear of conflict' alert; we alerted ATC; and descended back to 11;000 ft. After checking with the flight attendants to make sure no one was injured; we continued into ZZZ; completing the flight normally. The loss of separation was due to the other crews climbing prematurely and encroaching on our safety area. Crews should be encouraged to keep extra vigilant when told to maintain visual separation with other traffic. I also believe that crews should be discouraged in climbing in SPEED mode while above 10;000 ft.",,"CRJ-900 flight crew reported a NMAC with another aircraft that required evasive action while descending for landing.",

The purpose of this Engine Change was to comply with the following tasks - Objective 1 - R&R STAGE 1 TURBINE DISK; LIFE LIMIT; Objective 3 - R&R STAGE 1 AFT COOLING PLATE; LIFE LIMIT; and Objective 2 - R&R STAGE 2 TURBINE DISK; LIFE LIMIT. Per Company's direction; these tasks must be low in cycle count to be changed. Objective 1 and Objective 2 were at 7 cycles at the start of the flying; Objective 3 was at 4 cycles at the start of the flying day. Maintenance for this Engine Change was scheduled over the course of three days (also referred to as a CML (Continuous Maintenance Line) or Weekend Down). The plane was scheduled to be inducted into Maintenance at XA:45 on the first day; and be released at XB:00 on the third day. This was extended 1 day longer due to needed Maintenance Actions within the Maintenance Hanger. The plane was noted to be completed on Date. Maintenance Personnel sent the corresponding work order to their inspector on duty; the Inspector cleared the completed work order and scanned it into the database for planning review and closure of said work order. I closed the work order and carried on with the duties assigned to me by my manager. The aircraft was released back into operation by Maintenance Control and was dispatched for 6 flights within Company's market. The aircraft would then park in a Company Contract Maintenance base in ZZZ1 for the night with Objective 3; 2 cycles over its limit. The following day; Maintenance Control noticed that Objective 3 was showing -2 on the maintenance due report and questioned Maintenance Planning. Person A sent a copy of the page showing the negative with a message. The Maintenance Planner on Duty then replied 10 minutes later. Person B then sent an email to the Company Power Plant Team as well as the Records Department questioning this negative cycle count. Come to find out; ZZZ Maintenance changed the wrong Engine on the aircraft; and the Engine that flew the 6 cycles was indeed overflown by 2 cycles. This was discovered on Date 1. The plane was grounded and corrective action was taken by ZZZ1 Maintenance. Several things can be corrected here; first and foremost; if the correct engine was changed; we would have closed the work order and expected Aircraft Records to update the tasks that were showing due. This is because instead of scheduling the industrial tasks; we at Company scheduled a pre-made Engine Change Job Card. This does not take compliance for the tasks; but for an Engine Change itself. In this situation; a good change could be for Maintenance Personnel to write a Work Card requesting Maintenance Planning to take compliance for the tasks showing due or the tasks showing due be added to the work order with the Engine Change Job Card. But in this situation; the wrong engine was changed; therefore we would have still been overflown because we would have been taking compliance for the wrong engine. It is normal to let the task fly until Aircraft Records updates the information because we see that the engine change was signed off. This is for NLG; MLG; and Engine Changes. This is a very lax system; and the one fact no one saw coming hit it resulted in an overfly. No one would have imagined that ZZZ Maintenance would change the wrong engine; everyone assumes that the procedure down line would fall into place and everything would be taken care of accordingly. Also; [the computer system] updates Hours and Cycles on our Maintenance Due Reports and [spreadsheet] once a day; that is in the early morning before flying has occurred. Therefore all day those tasks were doing positive until the update the following morning where it showed negative. The engine is well overflown at the point; but the [spreadsheet] is still showing 4; and any Maintenance Due Report at this time would also show 4 in the cycle count section.",,"On Date; Aircraft X came in for a RH Engine Change. While positioning equipment that night I misread the position on the job card as LEFT. There was a heavy weekend coming up and I was hoping to turn the engine quickly to free up resources for the weekend. In my attempt to get a jump start on the change I did not verify S/N of the Engine to be removed and put the S/N off the job card on the Supplement. The result is that the LEFT Engine was changed instead of the RIGHT. This was my second engine change unassisted as a Crew Chief and I was focused on the actual change procedure. I also was under the impression that a recently repaired LH Engine was the one to be used; although I am not sure where that assumption came from.      I should've slowed down and verified the S/N on the data tag against the job card and not just use the S/N on the Job Card. Moving forward; I should also limit the number of days in a row I am working to prevent burnout or fatigue.",,"Maintenance Planner and Crew Chief reported the wrong engine was replaced during a scheduled maintenance resulting in overflying an engine that required replacement due to time cycle restricted components having reached their service limit. The aircraft was removed from service to correct the discrepancies.",

We completed the ECAMs and follow ups then I determined we needed to burn off fuel to avoid an overweight landing which would require vectors for approximately 15 minutes. The Jump Seater offered to make the PAs; coordinate with the Flight Attendants; and call to arrange a gate which greatly reduced my workload since myself and the FO were flying raw data while also troubleshooting and coordinating with ATC and programming to return to base. I was very concerned that upon landing I would lose control authority because of my experience on the takeoff roll and the history of the aircraft pulling to the right so we discussed this possibility and what to expect. We were able to land and return to the gate without further incident; however I did speak to the Maintenance Team that met the aircraft and they mentioned that as soon as they jacked up the aircraft to inspect the gear the nose gear shifted and pointed approximately 7 degrees to the right instead of being in the neutral position. They said because of this the sensors would not align and the aircraft would not retract the gear and the computers assumed we had not left the ground which is why the automation and other systems would not work. This aircraft pulling to the right was a previous write up.Maintenance could have dug further into a repeat write up. I could have committed to rejecting the takeoff as soon as I noticed directional control issues.",,,,"Captain reported full Left Pedal was required to maintain runway center line during take off.

It's possible we were given a takeoff clearance with less than prescribed. The 767 was given a heading of 090 on departure; and we were cleared RNAV JAMBA; which is roughly a 30 degree right turn off the runway; so I assumed the 767 was on a different SID/departure path; but that wasn't the case.Maybe more spacing; or being told we were following a heavy.

I volunteered to bring the Aircraft X into the event for display.Departing ZZZ1 winds were out of the South at 3-4 kts. and I departed Runway XY as a flight with an Aircraft Y attending the same event. Departure included a southbound turn off the departure end; leaving the delta airspace at ZZZ1 to the south. In route the ATIS weather was obtained at ZZZ which showed XXX at 18 Gusting 22 kts.; giving a crosswind component of 14-18 kts. Max demonstrated crosswind component for the Aircraft X is 15 mph which is 13 kts.Our flight separated into 2 seperate aircraft in order to ease the transition into ZZZ. I contacted Tower and advised that I had the weather and requested Runway XX which based on the ATIS was the marginally favored runway over Runway XXL. I was cleared straight in to XX.An uneventful approach led to short final on XX. I was able to maintain centerline without crab and the upwind wing low; giving me the impression landing was still feasible. Upon touchdown with the left main gear touching down first; the aircraft settled onto the right main gear as well. As the upwind wing leveled; additional full left aileron was added; as the left wing wanted to lift given the winds. With wings level; full left aileron; full left rudder and left differential braking applied on rollout; I was unable to maintain centerline.The aircraft was drifting in a crab toward the leeward side of the hard surface. Additional right brake was applied to attempt to arrest the forward motion prior to departing the hard surface which was not ultimately possible. The aircraft departed the hard surface into the grass adjacent to the runway at approximately 10-15 kts. forward speed; coming to rest approximately 15-20' of the right side of Runway XX. In the process of departing the runway; a runway edge light was struck by the right float outboard edge. This did not result in any damage to the aircraft however the light was knocked over.Once at a standstill; I conversed with Tower asking permission to taxi out of the grass. The aircraft was fully functional; without apparent damage and could easily be taxied across a small irrigation depression and onto a flat grass surface that allowed for return back to the approach end of Runway XX. Permission was granted to enter Runway XX and taxi to the ramp.Upon reaching the ramp; the aircraft was thoroughly examined; found to be free of damage. A report was given to the airport ground operations personnel at the aircraft per the Tower request. No additional information was requested;To summarize; there was a RLOC event at low speed 10-15 kts. This resulted in the aircraft leaving the leeward side of Runway XX into the grass adjacent to the runway approximately 15-20' off the hard surface and striking a runway edge light. No damage occurred to the aircraft; the aircraft could be taxied under its own power to the parking area without further event.Appropriate contact with airport authorities was executed and completed. Upon further discussion with pilots on the ground observing the landing; there appeared to be a strong gust just as the aircraft was touching down. The fly-in portion had been cancelled due to strong crosswinds for the event. Contributing factors include high crosswinds for aircraft capabilities. Human performance considerations include judgment lapse with strong crosswind component; a sense of pressure to arrive for the event on the ground due to the commitment; a lack of assertiveness in making a decision to divert due to winds given the social pressure of having another aircraft in the flight.",,,,"Pilot flying reported runway excursion during landing rollout.",

My check ride is approaching and I planned on staying in the pattern and doing takeoffs and landings. It had snowed the night before; and there was some fog over the airport; so I performed a full pre-flight and taxied the aircraft over to the FBO on the field to wait for the fog to clear. The fog lifted fully around XB:15; and I had been speaking with my instructor who recommended practicing short/soft field landings for my upcoming check ride. I contacted ground for taxi clearance to the active runway. Another aircraft called ground immediately after me requesting taxi. Tower then called out both our tail numbers to warn us of possible ice on the apron. I taxied to the run-up area and performed a full run-up. I prepped the aircraft for a short field takeoff (flaps; elevator); called tower for clearance; and upon getting cleared for takeoff began rolling out on to the runway. I got on center-line; added power; and started moving; holding the nose off; and adding right rudder to maintain center-line. As I approached about 50 MPH; the aircraft slipped horizontally to the left. There was no abrupt turn or change in attitude; the aircraft slid horizontally. I believe I hit black ice and the plane slipped towards the left edge of the runway. Upon feeling the slip; I immediately chopped power as I did not seem to have traction on the runway; and the aircraft continued sliding sideways; eventually ending up rolling into the snow in the grassy area between the runway and the taxiway. Tower confirmed audibly what I had experienced: the plane was rotating on center-line; moving forward; then had 'apparent slippage' off to the left. The plane was towed out of the snow by FBO staff; and was subsequently inspected by our mechanic on field after the incident; and was found to be in excellent condition. No damage to any part of the aircraft; no bald spots on the tires; no excess wear. This was a very sobering experience. In the future; I will likely wait some time after a snowstorm to ensure that runway surfaces are completely dry and clear of ice or slippery conditions. My best guess is the reduced traction with the nose wheel off the ground; the left turning tendencies of the plane; developing lift taking weight off the rear wheels; along with a runway that may not have been 100% clear of ice and slippery conditions all contributed to this incident occurring.",,,,"Student Pilot flying C-172 aircraft reported runway excursion on takeoff roll due to ice on runway.",

After retrieving weather and NOTAMs for ZZZ; I used pilot-controlled lighting to align the aircraft with the Runway XX center line and configured the aircraft for landing. At this point; IAS had returned and I had full operation of flight instruments. Upon touchdown; the aircraft aggressively veered to the left; uncommanded; and struck a snow bank. Upon further investigation of the aircraft; I believe the loss of directional control can be attributed to a pre-existing crack in the nose gear strut that malfunctioned on the touchdown. After the occurrence; I reflected on the situation and determined what I could have done differently to prevent or minimize the situation. While conducting the pre-flight inspection; I could have been more thorough and perhaps identified the crack of the nose gear and verified the operation of the pitot heat.

The headset from the ground had not been plugged in yet and luckily; no ground equipment was around the aircraft. After discussions through the inter phone with the ground crew; they had prematurely removed the chocks before there was any communications and before we could get clearance to pressurize hydraulics.Ground Crew inadequately chocking the aircraft; ground crew prematurely removing chocks before hydraulic system could be pressurized; and lack of communication with cockpit about their intentions. Using non standard procedures and making dangerous decisions regarding aircraft and personnel safety.I should have personally verified that additional chocks were brought to aircraft after we discussed the issue. But; there is no way of knowing how to prevent premature removal of chocks; especially when they had not even hooked up the ground headset for communication.

The Green Hydraulic System Reservoir Level Indications on the overhead panel and ECAM showed Low Fluid Level in the Green Hydraulic System. We began executing the ECAM and QRH procedures; briefed a game plan for recovering at ZZZ and [advised] ZZZ Center just prior to TOD. Sent a brief ACARS message to Dispatcher to apprise them of our situation and that we would require a tow upon landing. Also coordinated with ZZZ Ops via radio for a tug.  Manually extended the landing gear in accordance with the QRH (Green System Hydraulic Fluid Reservoir Indications jumped back into the normal range as soon as the landing gear handle was placed in the down position). Conducted a visual approach to [Runway] XXL and stopped on the runway without incident.

This was a failure of a single hydraulic component/system in an aging airframe. The redundant hydraulic systems; emergency procedures and alternate gear extension/braking systems worked as advertised. ATC; Crash Fire Rescue; Company Maintenance; and Operations Personnel all contributed to a safe and professional resolution of the incident. I do not know how it could have been prevented but I do think it validated the training; communication; and procedures for those agencies and personnel involved.",,"At FL320; 20 miles prior to top of descent (150 miles of flying remaining) on the STAR in ZZZ; we received a Master Caution and an ECAM Warning for Green System Hydraulic Low Pressure. The synoptic page showed the Green Fluid Level in the Amber with only 50 PSI of Pressure. The overhead panel showed the Green Fluid Hydraulic Level at the red dot in the Amber zone. The Captain (CA) and I verbalized what we saw; agreed that it looked legitimate; and he established duties - he would fly and I would run the problem. The ECAM directed us to shut off both Green Hydraulic Pumps; and to reference the Quick Reference Handbook for single system low hydraulic pressure. We turned off the Green Pumps; which turned off Autopilot 1; so we selected Autopilot 2. The QRH checklist directed us to turn our Brake Anti-Skid switch to alternate/on; guaranteeing some anti-skid with Yellow Hydraulics. We complied with this step; but the ECAM never turned the step from blue to white indicating completion. We each cycled the switch to ensure it was in the correct position. The procedure also had us reference increased landing distance charts; landing speed increment charts; fuel consumption increased charts; and a landing gear alternate extension checklist. Additionally it referenced the need to add 5 knots to our hook speed; flap speed; and slats speed. The QRH sent us to the Hydraulic Reservoir Low Level checklist which had us to turn off Pitch Feel 1; Spoiler 6; and examine the QRH table to identify which systems had been lost (Kruger Flaps; Auto Brakes; Autopilot 1; Pitch Trim 1; Pitch Feel 1; Nose Wheel Steering; Standby Generator); and which systems would be slow (Slats; Flaps; Spoilers). Throughout the entire recovery; the ECAM chime continued to ring and cycle through the pages as if new steps or problems were occurring;  even though we accomplished the steps and cleared the ECAM; it would constantly return; re illuminate the Master Caution; and change pages on us. It was a major distraction; particular for communication. None of the following prevented the ECAM from continuing to chime (every 5-10 seconds): ECAM clear button; Master Caution button; normal Warning Silence button.  Also; this was a dry ice supplementary procedures flight; meaning we had significant amounts of dry ice on board; requiring us to wear CO2 monitors and note the levels.  Because of the additional workload and communication and steps during the situation; the monitors frequently went off with an alert as occasional exhalation would set off the monitor alert function. This was another distraction; but we could mitigate it by confirming the alert level was low; and silencing the audible warning (until the process repeated). Before I computed landing distances; speeds; and fuel consumption; we discussed our game plan and I suggested we fly the normal STAR; get vectors in the terminal area for a 20 mile extended final as configuration would take longer and we'd have to crank down our gear. The Captain concurred and we agreed to request Runway XXL because we'd be shutting down the runway with no steering; and it was the main recovery window for company to [Runway] XXR. We also agreed we'd need to coordinate a tow. I coordinated our plan with ZZZ Center; while the Captain flew and rebuilt the new STAR and approach in the FMS and ILS head. We completed the QRH; briefed the star and approach; and ran our normal checklists. The Captain contacted the Dispatcher via ACARS to give them a heads up; and I contacted company ramp tower at ZZZ to request their help in getting a tug out to [Runway] XXL. We executed our plan; configured in accordance with our brief; additionally briefed the non-standard go-around procedure that was required should we need it; as well as braking and distance considerations. I manually cranked the gear down. Before we completed the final steps of the landing gear alternate extension checklist; we were concerned because we had gear unlocked red indications; plus the green gear down lights. But once we put the landing gear handle down per the QRH; the unlocked lights extinguished. Additionally; at that point; the fluid level in the reservoir returned almost to normal. The Captain made a very nice heavyweight landing; we stopped on the runway; and spoke with Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) to inspect the plane for any fluid leaks on the plane or runway.  None were found; so we coordinated our tug and escort back to the gate; where it was discovered that hydraulic fluid was dripping out of the left engine.  A loss of hydraulic fluid and pressure in the green system; later determined to be an engine pump pressure switch leak. It couldn't have been prevented. Parts occasionally fail after sufficient hours and cycles of use.",,"A300 flight crew reported receiving a master caution and an ECAM warning for Green System Hydraulic Low Pressure.

Since change to advisory was approved by Approach control; we started to make our regular radio calls on the CTAF and listened to other calls on the frequency. Our own ADSB on the iPads as well as in the airplane showed (in addition to traffic in the pattern) one aircraft behind and above us approaching angular our straight in final approach course. We continued our descend and reduced our speed for horizontal separation. Neither I nor the safety pilot heard any additional radio calls than these of aircraft's in the pattern (no one said that they are on a straight in approach). As we further continued on our shown glidepath; we noticed that the aircraft behind us has turned onto the final approach course and is moving and descending faster than we are. The aircraft was approaching 400 ft. (shown on the ADSB) above and just slightly behind us; when the safety pilot made a radio call and tries to reach the aircraft. As no one responded he tried it a second time and got an answer that they are on the same frequency. The aircraft was directly above us (300 ft. shown on the ADSB) when the safety pilot informed them about the situation and asked for their intentions. They then started to do a right 360 degree turn to clear the situation. How the problem arose - aircraft approaching us without making radio calls. How it was discovered - ADSB inside aircraft and own one connected with iPads. Contributing factors - a lot of traffic in Venice (Many radio calls in the pattern); we had no visual contact because we had a Shoulder wing aircraft and the traffic was above (the other aircraft was regarding to Flightradar24 a low wing aircraft; so they maybe also did not have visual contact to us). Corrective actions - try to establish radio contact and aircraft making a 360. Perceptions/judgments - due to the aircraft being quite high and approach angular; we assumed that they will not do an approach into VNC.",,,,"Pilot on a practice instrument approach reported a NMAC while descending into VNC airport.",

I had pre-flighted the aircraft with the storms in mind. The aircraft is based on a flight line on an outside ramp. The flight was normal with all parameters normal up until the descent to landing. At that time; my airspeed indicator and my altimeter failed. While I managed to continue to fly without them; it took quite a few seconds to assess that there was a problem; and to determine a course of action. My airspeed indicator was indicating more than 30 knots high. My altimeter as I found out later was indicating about 250 feet high. Both of these situations are extremely unsafe; particularly when in the traffic pattern; and I discovered that I was low and slow and took a quick action to ameliorate the situation. I believe that the static system had water in it from the severe storms; and that it had frozen when I had gone up to altitude. It did not unfreeze until after I had brought the airplane to its parking spot and tied it down. Operationally; we are looking to modify our procedures; post storms; so that this does not happen again. An additional contributing factor is that my Passenger was feeling nauseous due to the local turbulence; which perhaps caused me a delay in recognizing that there was a problem. While I am happy that the flight resulted in a reasonable short final and landing; and I am grateful for my years experience; I believe that a more careful consideration of the effect of these historic storms on my aircraft would have served me well.",,,,"Pilot reported airspeed and altitude errors on approach to landing.

Person A was working FIMR position; we had just returned the FIMR scope to the actual FIMR scope; we had been operating FIMR at Glendale Radar (GLNR) due to intermittent frequencies. We had been operating on Emergency Communication System (ECS) 135.05. The tech had reset the transmission on ECS 120.4 (it was inoperable and in alarm) we tested the frequency with two aircraft. It appeared to work; Aircraft X was being vectored to VNY ILS final. When suddenly he could not hear any transmissions. He went through final at 050 into a 060 MVA. Aircraft X called VNY Tower; he told VNY Tower that he had the field in sight and they cleared him for the visual approach. Recommendation: We need an operable frequency for the FIMR position. For about the past six days frequencies have been intermittent. 120.4 Primary; standby; BUR tunable; 135.05; etc. are all out of service. 120.4 ECS is unreliable and had dropped earlier in the day and throughout the week. We tried 119.85; it did not work. So we moved the FIMR position to GLNR scope and used 135.05 ECS. Later on we moved FIMR position to FIMR scope and utilized 135.05 ECS. As I typed this up we had a separate TCAS RA on this position due to the aircraft not hearing the controller. The ECS frequencies are not strong enough nor designed to be utilized for this position. I discussed options with the operations manager; and have decided to close the FIMR position and combine it at Woodland Radar (WDLR) 134.2 primary frequency. We need 120.4 Primary and Secondary to return to service before FIMR can be de-combined safely; in my opinion. This puts a heavy workload on WDLR as they are now working both BUR and VNY arrivals during heavy traffic. Traffic Management Unit has added flow to assist in the safe operation of the WDLR/FIMR position combined. The ECS frequencies (be it 120.4; 135.05; 119.85) is completely unreliable and we have no other frequency we can depend on to talk to aircraft.",,,,"SCT Controller reported transmitter failures that resulted in an aircraft entering a higher MVA and in a CFTT situation.",

This is especially prevalent in ZZZ and ZZZ1. In ZZZ; pushback is fairly shallow and straight back. In order to get the aircraft to turn; I have to get the aircraft to roll forward slightly prior to beginning the turn. This leads to the wingtip crossing over the painted ground equipment 'ROAD' on the ramp. Prior to beginning forward movement I turn the taxi light on a signal that the aircraft is moving. However; our own Ground traffic (including catering trucks) never yield and drive directly in front of the aircraft. I often have to stop the aircraft to allow the ground equipment to pass. This is unacceptable and a symptom of poor training of our Ramp Staff. We are asking for an incident where a scimitar winglet aircraft has contact with a catering truck; or worse; where we have an actual crash between ground equipment and an aircraft. In addition; once I've stopped the aircraft; after rolling forward; it makes the required thrust to complete the turn greater; leading to increased likelihood of injury or damage due to jetblast.

We had flaps 20 and full takeoff thrust selected due to a LLWS Advisory in the ATIS. During climbout; I was hand flying and requested VNAV at 1;000 feet AGL and then requested flaps to 5. Shortly thereafter; I requested the Autopilot to be engaged for the RNAV departure. This was followed in quick succession with Flaps to 1; then Flaps Up; after takeoff checklist; climb 2. At some point after the Flaps Lever was raised to Up; we heard a pop sound and received a TE FLAPS DISAGREE EICAS Message. The Flap Indicator was positioned between Up and 1 with no split. The Autopilot disengaged and I began hand flying the aircraft again. I immediately kept the speed at clean maneuvering (around 200 KIAS) and the Captain (CA) told me to level off at 4;000 feet. The Captain informed ATC that we had a mechanical problem and needed to level off. She also requested vectors to keep us clear of terrain. It was night and we were in and out of clouds with turbulence and rain. ATC began providing vectors and directed a climb to 5;000 feet. During this time; I requested that the Captain re-engage the Autopilot. However; none of the Autopilots would engage. I then realized that the aircraft required a lot of Right Aileron to stay level. I then added about 7 units of right rudder trim to assist. The Captain directed that I continue flying the aircraft as she got into the TRAILING EDGE FLAPS DISAGREE checklist. She ran the checklist until it reached a decision point to continue that checklist; or go to the TRAILING EDGE FLAPS ASYMMETRY checklist. The deciding factor; per the checklist; was whether the TE EDGE light was still illuminated or not. However; we never received a TE EDGE light during the flight and tested the bulb twice to confirm. Due to having noticeable asymmetry in flight; the Captain opted to go to the TE FLAP ASYMMETRY checklist and ran it to the landing section. At this point; the Captain took the aircraft and asked that I review all of the checklists again while she flew. We decided to try engaging the Autopilot again and it did engage; likely due to the trim we had input. Around this time; we also requested priority handling with ATC and then I began running the checklists starting with TE FLAP DISAGREE. After some discussion and the lack of a Trailing Edge Light; I moved the Alternate Flaps Switch from up to 1. This initially appeared to solve the problem as the Flap Indicator was now indicating Flaps 1 and the TE FLAPS DISAGREE EICAS rescinded. However; as I began removing the Rudder Trim for the Captain; she quickly asked that I return the Rudder Trim to 7 units as there was still a noticeable Asymmetry. I returned the Rudder Trim and the Captain asked that I contact Flight Control for further guidance. We also decided to request a holding pattern to continue troubleshooting; which ATC granted. We were unable to contact Flight Control via Jet Comm; so we asked the Local Operations Office to phone patch us to Flight Control and talk over speaker. After establishing contact; we requested to speak to a Subject Matter Expert (SME). After a long discussion of the checklists and our actions up to that point with the SME; we decided to complete the TRAILING EDGE FLAP ASYMMETRY checklist and not to attempt to move the Flaps again. We then requested landing performance data that included the malfunction and to use the longest runway; completed our briefings; and requested vectors to the ILS. ATC was very busy with arrivals and asked if we could accept 15 minutes of vectors. Due to not needing to land immediately; and to burn off more fuel to lighten the aircraft; we accepted the vectors. The Captain took this opportunity to talk about the high speed landing that was required and asked me to read her the section from the Flight Crew Training Manual (FCTM) about landing with a Flap Asymmetry. We were then vectored to and intercepted the ILS. We completed all deferred items remaining in the TRAILING EDGE FLAPS ASYMMETRY checklist. The Captain flew the approach to about 400 feet; then disconnected the Autopilot and landed the aircraft with no issues. After landing; we assessed that the aircraft was safe to taxi back to the ramp. We cleared off the Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) team; taxied to the ramp and shutdown the aircraft.",,"The flight was scheduled ZZZ to ZZZ1. The active runway was XXR. LLWS was in the ATIS so I elected to do Flaps 20 with a delayed rotation; maximum thrust take off; engine anti ice on as per the takeoff performance data. LNAV was armed for the ZZZZZ SID. Cleared for takeoff; First Officer (FO) leg. When taxing on to Runway XXR we got an EICAS Left Side Window. Informed ATC; take off clearance canceled; taxied off runway. Did the QRH procedure which cleared the EICAS; also understood a comment write up would be accomplished on the way to ZZZ1. Cleared to take off again Runway XXR. At 1;000 feet FO called for VNAV; Flaps 5; Autopilot Center Command. FO called for Flaps 1; Flaps Up; after takeoff checklist; climb 2. This all came quickly due to the light aircraft and maximum thrust take off. When selecting Flaps Up I heard a loud bang (pop); got a TE FLAPS DISAGREE EICAS (no TE Light Illuminated) and Flap Indicator was between Up and 1. The Autopilot disengaged and the aircraft required approximately 7 to 10 units of Right Rudder Trim to keep wings level. I informed ATC of the flight control malfunction; asked for vectors to work the problem; and requested priority handling. ATC instructed us to climb to 5;000 feet. At this time we were able to re-engage the Autopilot since the aircraft was in trim. The TE FLAP DISAGREE checklist was called for. The FO continued to fly as I worked the checklist. At step 9 of this checklist it states; [to] choose one. So; we had the TE FLAP DISAGREE EICAS still displayed; but no TE Light (never got light just an EICAS). After some discussion exited the checklist and went to the TE FLAP ASYMMETRY checklist as stated to do so in step 9. Once again only the TE FLAP DISAGREE EICAS Message in view at this time. Still holding 7 to 10 units of Right Rudder Trim. Ran the TE FLAP ASYMMETRY checklist up to the check landing data statement. At this point I asked the FO to review the checklist and I would fly the aircraft. Even though we both went threw the checklist initially; the FO was busy flying the aircraft and dealing with airspeed control; turbulence; rain showers; etc.; at that time. The TE FLAP DISAGREE checklist was reviewed first by my FO. After some more discussion about not having the TE Light Illuminated (tested bulbs twice); the Alternate Flap Switch was placed to Flaps 1. The Flap Indicator now showed Flaps 1; however a Rudder Trim of 7 to 10 units was still needed. Left the checklist and decided to call Flight Control and talk to a System Matter Expert (SME). Tried Comms; ZZZ and no luck. Got a hold of ZZZ gateway to relay a message to our Dispatcher; Flight Control; and a SME. During this time we asked for a hold from ATC which was granted. Had a lengthy discussion with the SME about the situation of the aircraft. I decided because of the 7 to 10 units of Right Rudder needed to keep wings level that we had an Asymmetry issue. I did not want to further jeopardize the aircraft's attitude. We ran the TE FLAP ASYMMETRY checklist again to completion. We got the non normal landing data and planned to land Runway XY; Flaps 1 indicated; at ZZZ. The approach was briefed and the deferred items descent; approach; and landing checklists were accomplished. ATC was very busy with arrivals and asked if we could accept 15 minutes of vectors. Due to not needing to land immediately; and to burn off more fuel to lighten the aircraft we accepted vectors. While being vectored for an extended downwind I had my FO pull up the all flap landing information; and landing with an asymmetry in the FCTM (Flight Crew Training Manual) for review. We did the ILS XY coupled to 400 feet; then disconnected the Autopilot and landed. After landing we assessed that the aircraft was safe to taxi to the ramp.",,"Flight Crew reported when selecting Flaps Up I heard a loud bang (pop); a TE FLAPS DISAGREE EICAS (no TE Light Illuminated) and Flap Indicator was between Up and 1 after takeoff. The Flight Crew requested vectors and ran the check lists and QRH. After talking with Operations and a SME; the Flight Crew requested priority handling and performed an air turn back and precautionary landing at departure airport.",

The Co-pilot was the Pilot Flying (PF); we made the 'TOGA' followed by the '80' call outs and approximately 90 plus knots (difficult to remember exactly) we both heard an audible loud 'boom' sound and realized that the left engine had failed from indications on the EICAS system. The 'reject' and ' my aircraft' calls were made and as Pilot In Command (PIC); I assumed control and brought the aircraft to a stop on the runway. I made the PA to the Passengers to remain seated 3 times and advised the Flight Attendants (FA) that we had a problem. The Co-pilot was already talking to Tower about our situation. The Tower Controllers initially thought we blew a tire but we informed them we had an Engine Failure. They asked if we required Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) assistance and initially after making a quick assessment we told them no. We knew no QRH checklist existed for an engine failure on the ground so; initially we did not run a QRH checklist. I recall either we asked the Tower or the Tower Controller said he may have seen smoke. At that point I told the Co-pilot to ask Tower to roll the ARFF. The exchange from the Tower gave us the impression that whatever smoke they may have seen was slightly after the engine had failed. I made the decision that it was safe to taxi and we parked in-front of the fire house at ZZZ airport. We elected to run the engine fire QRH doing only items we deemed applicable. We called and informed Operations of our dilemma and spoke to Maintenance and were given a gate. I made a PA telling the Passengers that vehicles would approach the aircraft from both sides but this was only precautionary. I spoke directly to the ARFF Fire Commander and asked them to asses the engines and wheel areas of the aircraft for signs of damage; smoke; fire etc. I asked if they saw anything that would prevent a safe taxi to the gate; they responded that they saw no signs as such. We had a few passengers get up to use the lavatory and I had to make a PA twice I recall to remind them that we needed them seated. I asked ARFF to follow us to the gate. Maintenance met us at the gate while they secured the data they needed; I stood at the door to personally thank every single passenger as they deplaned. I was told by Maintenance that my logbook entry had to be more precise on what speed we aborted at. I recalled somewhere around 92 knots which I put in the logbook. The Chief Pilot and a representative met us at the gate and we explained what happened. None come to mind; maintenance is more apt to answer this question. Again; until I know exactly what caused the left engine to fail; answering this question would purely be premature in my humble opinion.",,"All was well with our flight everything called for and completed as per standard operating procedures. Lined up on [Runway] XXR; engines spooled and stabilized at 40 % N1. I was the Pilot Flying (PF) at this time. I clicked TOGA and made the call. The 80 kts call was made and checked by myself when I noticed I needed a lot more right rudder than usual. Below approximately 90 kts; a huge explosion could be heard the plane started pulling to the left at this time. Firm right rudder was applied to maintain center line. The reject call was made; the Captain (CA) assumed controls of the aircraft and brought the airplane to a stop at that time. The Captain was on the PA I was speaking with the Tower. We both assessed and both confirmed it was indeed an engine failure on the number 1 engine. We were asked by Tower if we could have taxied off the runway on our own power but we still were in assessment stage. Eventually we got the airplane rolling and we were told by another airplane smoke was coming out the number one engine. I called ATC and asked the fire trucks to meet us in the pad closest to the fire station to give us a look. Once the parking brake was set I made a check to see if there was an engine failure on the ground checklist. There was none. Just as a precaution we ran over a few items of the engine failure checklist just to be sure and that applied to our current situation. The Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) checked us out and we were cleared thereafter to go to the gate and we were followed by the fire trucks.",,"B737 flight crew reported an engine failure during the takeoff roll at approximately 90 knots.

I was flying with a CA (Captain) I had yet to fly with out of the ZZZ base. I arrived early as usual; and proceeded to do a walk around; and then started on duties to prepare the aircraft for the flight. The CA arrived on time; and began a series of his duties. The CA noticed the Radar Altimeter was not working; and alerted [maintenance] to the issue. [Maintenance] was able to get the RA working; and we departed ZZZ for ZZZ1. Upon passing through 10;000 ft'; I asked the CA if he would like me to turn the APU on. He replied 'No; we will turn it on during short final.' I thought I misheard him. During short final; while the CA was flying; he reached up and turned on the APU; without announcing or asking me to do so. I told him I could do that; and he said it was fine. The landing was unremarkable. We departed ZZZ1 for ZZZ2. Winds were gusty but nothing out of limits. During descent through landing checks; the CA failed to use a checklist and instead called out items from memory. I asked about it and didn't get a response. I was unsure if he understood me; as it seems as though communication was difficult. The CA has a very heavy accent; and I had difficulty understanding a few things he said and had to ask him to repeat himself. Once again; the CA turns the APU on during short final; although this time I was flying. Landing was normal. We taxi to parking and shut down. The next stop is ZZZ3. The CA looks at the winds; which were gusting to 31 at 150; with landings being conducted to RWY XX; and tells me they are almost at max crosswind. I disagree; but he shows me the METAR and once again says 35 knots is the max crosswind limitation. I did not explain how the calculation worked; and decided not to since we would be legal even under his interpretation of max crosswind.During preflight on the leg back to ZZZ; I had done a weight and balance and asked the CA if he wanted to use it. I am not sure if he heard me as he began doing his own; and input it into the FMS. I did not discover until after landing; when the CA sent me his movement report to show times; that he did not include 6 passengers on the weight and balance calculations. On all legs; the CA turned on the APU during short final. I was SIC; operating from ZZZ to ZZZ4. I was the PM (Pilot Monitoring) ; the CA was the pilot flying. The flight was uneventful until arrival into ZZZ4. The CA had set the inbound course on both sides of the MCP (Mode Control Panel) and tuned both VHF NAV radios to the frequency for the localizer on RWY XY in preparation for the approach into ZZZ4. ATC had assigned a heading of 110 as we approached the airport. We ran an approach checklist around 7;000 ft and concluded the checklist. The CA had then tuned VHF #1 to tower; ahead of the approach as I was talking to approach and preparing for landing. Weather was VFR; winds were unremarkable. The aircraft we were on had HSI switches; and once closer both were set to VOR/ILS to prepare for the approach. ATC told us to remain at 3;000 ft until established and cleared us for the ILS into RWY XY. Upon being cleared; the CA armed the approach on the MCP. However; during a scan I noticed our course deflection bars were wildly different. I immediately announced this. Mine was saying we needed to turn right; the CA side was saying to turn slightly left. The route in the FMC had the ILS for runway XY. My VHF nav frequency was tuned correctly; but upon looking down the CAs was no longer correct. Without speculating too much; the only thing I could come up with is that this may have been inadvertently off tuned after the approach checklist; when the CA tuned the VHF radio to tower as the pilot flying; because the knobs for the VHF 1 radio and VHF nav radio are the exact same; and one is right above the other. When correcting the mistake the wrong frequency may have been input. It was about the time that I announced a second time the HSIs were different that ATC called and said '[callsign]; what are you doing?' And told us to make an immediate turn to 170 as it looked as though the aircraft was heading towards runway XZ; which was closed. The CA was attempting to tell [maintenance] something was wrong with the plane after I read back the instructions. I was telling the CA we needed to turn to 170 immediately; as he continued flying the wrong heading. The CA kept trying to press heading mode on the MCP; but it would not work as we were captured on the wrong glideslope and localizer. The CA then lost his FD (Flight Director) guidance. I told him nothing he was telling [maintenance] was important as he continued flying on the wrong heading. I raised my voice when my concerns weren't heard and said we needed to turn to 170 IMMEDIATELY and to disengage the autopilot and turn; and I would work on the inside. The A/P ended up disengaging on its own; due to a radar altimeter that was inop (this explanation according to maintenance; the radar altimeter was MEL'd; but there are no VHF nav restrictions on said MEL; only RNAV and RNP restrictions.) The CA then decided to engage my A/P (B side) and selected heading mode as I had tuned his VHF nav to the correct frequency. He still had no FD guidance; and I did not believe that; in VFR conditions and being that close to the runway; that running the QRH and transferring instrument switches to guidance on my side was appropriate. Once we were on the heading assigned; ATC asked if we had the airport in sight. The field was seen and we were cleared for the visual into runway XY. The CA used heading to turn us towards the runway. Once we were lined up; the CA disengaged the autopilot; and began descending. My guidance for the ILS was still working; but the CA had no FD guidance on his side. I announced we were getting too low approaching buildings on the south east side of the airport. The CA said 'visual visual.' I once again announced we were too low and likely to receive a terrain warning from the GPWS as we descended below 1;000 ft (980 ft when the CA pulled up) outside of the FAF (at 1;600 ft) with full scale glideslope deflection on my side. I announced the glideslope was well above us as I had guidance. The CA pulled aft on the yoke and advanced the power levers into a climb getting the aircraft into a flight profile where the PAPI was showing two white and two red when I looked up again. The landing was unremarkable. The flight back into ZZZ was my leg. During the landing roll almost immediately upon touchdown; tower started calling while I was still getting the aircraft under control (100+ knots.) I key the mic and tell them to standby. The CA keys the mic and reads instructions back; to a high speed taxiway we ended up not making as I was unable to slow the aircraft in time. After exiting; the CA begins to taxi; and turns off every light on his panel and the engine instruments; making it to where they were unreadable. Poor CRM; poor decision making by the CA; unsafe actions during flight and taxi; lack of understanding of crosswind calculations; lack of prioritizing immediate actions during flight with a pilot error that needed to be fixed. I did everything in my power to attempt to tell the CA the deviations during all legs of flights. I have decided I will attempt to avoid flying with this CA in the future.",,,,"Air Carrier First Officer reported a Captain that displayed poor decision making skills; a lack of understanding of basic tasks; and inadequate CRM during multiple legs of a trip.",

I could smell an electrical odor and shut off the recirc fans and the packs. I also closed the bleeds engine and APU just in case that was the source. Flight Attendant and Passengers were starting to panic from the smoke as I exited the cockpit. The cause of the smoke was a lithium ion battery attached to a thermos. The owner was coming forward with it. I quickly grabbed it and exited the aircraft. I proceeded out of the jetbridge to a place on the ramp that wasn't close to anything. When I exited the aircraft and told the Flight Attendant to deplane the aircraft thru the forward door. There was a fire extinguisher on the ramp I uncovered and monitored the situation. The fire department arrived and took command of the situation.The number one Flight Attendant came to the cockpit to see if we had a containment bag. Theirs is in the middle of the cabin and was not able to be reached because of the people in the aisle. A bag in the forward galley would be helpful. She was hesitant to grab the thermos and exit the aircraft. In my opinion this may have been from the FAA and companies' policy of the Flight Attendants are not allowed to exit the aircraft with Passengers on board. It was a high stress situation; and we are briefing them to not leave the aircraft when the truth is action needs to be taken and that was removing the threat. It all worked out and will be hard to prevent. I do think Passengers are going to carry Lithium-ion batteries on the aircraft in things we are not expecting. A containment kit in the forward galley would be helpful.

We were cleared to intercept the course and once established cleared the ILS for XX. We were hustling down to 3;000 ft. and trying to slow and configure and realized we hadn't armed the approach (GS) function and did just as the aircraft was leveling and the GS was below us thinking it would arm. We configured and had a large ground speed mini factor with turbulence that made it difficult to get fully configured. Once we were we completed the before landing checklist and then realized the AP had not captured the GS and we were below glide slope and descending. So we arrested the decent and then executed a go around. On the go we got an altitude and heading from tower and during the clean up stage got a master warning for a Vfe exceeded as the flaps were in retraction from flaps one to zero even though the barber pole had already jump above our current airspeed as we selected them up before our airspeed could enter the barber pole territory. Cleaned up and completed a successful approach to ILS XX with moderate turbulence and a ground speed mini that was close to thirty knots over Vapp. Called Maintenance Control once at the gate and told them the situation with the flaps and they said not to write it up since our airspeed never showed us in the actual barber pole. [Event caused by] getting a slam dunk approach in IMC with turbulence and wind shear made it difficult to get get established and stable. With those factors and the AP not capturing the GS and not recognizing that right away while being focused on getting slowed and configured more than we should've we comprised the approach. We fixated on one or two issues and forgot our scan for a few moments that lead to the go around. ATC not giving the usual VFR slam dunk approach with IMC conditions with active weather.

AGL the winds died down as the cross wind correction was being put in and caused a slip increasing descent rate which caused a hard landing. The cross wind correction put in as well as the sudden change in wind speed caused us to be in a slip like state which caused us to have an increased descent rate at the moment it occurred it was unrecoverable. Suggestions: Looking forward to how to mitigate. Following company policies for Second in Command crosswind limitation even though we train for a higher tolerance should still be followed which would have mitigated the threat.",,"On short approach the aircraft was positioned well for landing.  As the airplane was in the last 20-30 feet before touch down; the wind subsided causing a drop in airspeed and thus lift; hitting the ground at a much faster rate than the anticipation.

No other failures were noted. The Pilot Flying took over the radio communications and I went to the QRH. Consulting the Non EICAS Abnormality section did not give us any remedy for the issue. After advising our Dispatcher and Maintenance Control of our situation and the lack of a QRH procedure; we were told by MX (Maintenance) Control to consult [specific pages in a manual]. This was a MFD Fault Reset procedure that could only be accomplished on the ground. The Captain and I elected to continue with the RNAV X [Runway] XX approach as all necessary data could be derived from the FMS. As a result of the decision to continue with our planned approach; we did not feel it was necessary to advise Air Traffic Control. The approach was successful and Maintenance was brought on board at the gate. The event was a result of a system failure that was not able to be fixed inflight. After arrival; MX was able to clear the issue and the aircraft continued to ZZZ1. The issue was thoroughly briefed after we determined it would not be fixed and after taking into account all variables we determined a quality approach could be achieved to runway XX. I believe the situation was handled appropriately. We expanded our team and there was nothing to be done about the display failures. Our Dispatcher had no hesitations about us completing the RNAV [Runway] XX.

Our aircraft was clear to land and under 500 feet when an aircraft holding short of our landing runway (Runway XX) was presumably cleared to cross Runway XX and Runway XY on Taxiway XX. At our adjusted minimums (310 feet) auto callout; the conflicting aircraft was not clear of the landing runway and the flight crew initiated a go-around. Go-around was called by the Pilot Monitoring (PM) (myself) and executed per company procedures and complied with all published and ATC instructions. As our crew was monitoring tower; and not ground; we cannot know what was ordered of the aircraft causing an imminent runway incursion; but we would like to know why Ground may have cleared an aircraft to cross in a potentially dangerous phase of flight.I understand ZZZ is very busy; and they conduct an impossible operation on an unreasonably small area of real-estate; but if a go around was not called by the flight crew a runway incursion would most likely have occurred.  That would be unacceptable.  My suggestion is that ZZZ stop crossing traffic using such small margins of safety.",,"The background setting of this event was that ZZZ had just experienced a brief ground stop which caused a high level of congestion both on the ground and in the air.

At approximately 300-400 feet on about a 1 mile final; the Captain (CA) noticed that there was an aircraft taxiing across the south end of the runway (XY or XX Taxiway). The Captain noticed this traffic first and promptly called a go around which we executed without issue. We made left traffic and returned for a landing on Runway XX. My suggestion would be for air traffic control to be a bit more conservative with runway crossings due to the time it takes for some aircraft get forward momentum from a stop while taxiing.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a critical ground conflict while on short-final approach due to an aircraft crossing runway.

Visibility was 5 miles in haze; and we were able to see the runway just outside of the FAF (ZZZZZ; RNAV XX). I checked in with tower and we're subsequently cleared to land. I illuminated the landing lights and the PF (Pilot Flying) stated 'cleared to land' after my response of landing clearance to tower. As per usual I dialed in the ground frequency using the rotary knob and had it in standby. At this point we were both focused on landing while getting fully configured. As we continued inbound and got to 500 ft I stated '500 stable' to which the PF stated 'landing'. As we got closer probably about 1-200 ft. the PF stated that there was an airplane almost on the runway but not quite. I looked to see but initially only saw a small airplane like a Cherokee further back due to the center piece of the windshield impeding my view. As we got closer I then did see Aircraft Y really close to the runway and thought that the hold short line was really close to the runway. We continued the landing as we felt it was safe since the Aircraft Y did not seem to be intruding onto the runway. Once we landed; the controller asked if 'Aircraft X was on ground frequency'; I responded 'negative' he then said 'who said negative?' I then responded 'Aircraft X'. He then stated 'tower told you to go-around due to aircraft on the runway and you didn't respond' He then gave us a number to call tower. Once we taxied in; shutdown and accomplished all checklists and duties; we called the tower number. Somehow; the ground frequency had been switched from standby to active but neither of us remember even hearing the chime when frequencies are swapped on the GTC (Garmin Touch Controllers). [The Controller] stated they called us starting at about a 1 mile final to 'go-around' and made several calls after that. We were on ground frequency so did not hear them. We tested the GTC radio frequency swap twice on the ground with no chime; then after a third attempt we got a chime. During the remainder of the flight the chime always sounded when we changed frequencies. Somewhere on final approach after landing clearance; one of us must have inadvertently swapped frequencies on accident and didn't catch it. In my case; unrecognized fatigue may have been a factor that led to a loss of situational awareness. I started the day prior with an [early morning wake up and show time]. My duty time that day was 13:57 minutes. We had a shutdown of XA07 local EST with a show time of XA00 EST the day of the incident. That morning I woke up at XJ30 EST which was XG30 body clock time. I don't believe my body had adjusted fully to the time change at this point; so it is entirely possible that I may have inadvertently touched the GTC without noticing or hearing a chime; due to the effects of an inconspicuous progressing of fatigue even though I felt OK.After this incident; I've started to glance at each frequency change on the upper right PFD to ensure that I'm communicating with the correct controller. I periodically glance at it to ensure I'm where I'm supposed to be. This may be helpful in preventing a future situation such as we had. Also; I will pay closer attention to the chatter on the frequency to see if it makes sense; i.e.) hearing ground or clearance delivery when I should be hearing tower. Lastly; I believe duty time and rest periods have to be managed better in order to keep pilots alert. I now realize after the fact; that fatigue definitely played a role in not catching the frequency change; basically a degradation of situational awareness. Fatigue is insidious and it's usually too late when a person realizes they're fatigued. After a long duty day it normally takes a while to unwind and get adequate rest once a pilot gets to his/her hotel room. To add to this; we usually get up 1-1.5 hours prior to show the next morning to prepare for the duty day ahead so the quality of rest may not beoptimal. I also believe that we should have just called for a go around. As mentioned earlier; while the aircraft didn't look like it was intruding onto the runway from our vantage point; it was close. In retrospect the nose of the aircraft was probably just over the runway edge white marking. Because of this it was unusual; and I know believe if in a similar situation in the future; I will call for a go-around simply because something didn't look right. This would undoubtedly had corrected the incorrect frequency as ground control would have switched us over to tower.",,"The following comments are not meant to absolve myself of any responsibility - I take full ownership of the conduct of this flight - but to articulate my view of what happened and what was in my thought process as the situation unfolded. Nut shell: We landed on runway XX in ZZZ with our comm radio tuned to ground control frequency. Another aircraft (Aircraft Y) had blundered past the runway XX hold short line at [Taxiway] 1; causing a significant loss of separation. Tower called us several times to go-around; but we never heard them because we were not up on tower frequency. How?:The short answer is that my crew mate (PM) and I do not know how comm 1 switched; or got switched; from tower to ground frequency. Neither do we know how that could have happened without our becoming aware of it.  I was PIC and PF (Pilot Flying) in the left seat of a repositioning flight from ZZZ1 to ZZZ. Weather was 210/13G18 5SM HZ SCT015 26/23 29.95. TRACON cleared us for the RNAV XX and switched us to ZZZ Tower. PM checked in with Tower; who cleared us to land runway XX. We both acknowledged landing clearance and PM (Pilot Monitoring) moved the lights switch from taxi to landing; all per our SOPs. So far; so good. I am not sure of the timing; whether right after making contact with Tower or upon receiving landing clearance; but the PM entered the ground control frequency in the comm 1 standby. Doing this is basically de facto SOP: I and nearly every other pilot I fly with do this as a regular habit; to help smooth and safely expedite the transition from landing to taxiing. I believe this is good practice.At some point after receiving our landing clearance; and unbeknownst to us; the ground control frequency swapped from the standby to the active. How that happened is the million dollar question. Obviously; there is no reason for us to deliberately change to ground; and I do not remember either of us making any moves on Comm 1 that could have inadvertently triggered the swap. I have observed the PM is; like me; a 'grinder' who typically uses the old school; rotating and pushable tuning knobs on the GTC (Garmin Touch Controllers) to tune and swap frequencies (vs using the touchscreen method); which requires a bit more conscious and physical effort to change frequencies compared to using the touchscreen. So; it seems unlikely that a 'fat finger' caused the swap; whether it was immediately after entering the ground frequency into the standby or moments later.Did I cause the swap? As PF I wouldn't normally be handling comm 1 during landing. Again; I don't remember touching it but also know that; try as I might; I am not immune to bad habits.Did comm 1 swap frequencies on its own? This also seems unlikely: in my [years and thousands of hours] of Phenom 300 time I have not seen that happen. On the other hand; in that time I have seen and heard of various; one off; unexplained anomalies (Phenomena?) in the Garmin avionics and other systems. Perhaps it's not impossible.In any case; our standard avionics setup has the 'COM Frequency Changed Tone' alert enabled; which should have alerted us to the frequency change. But neither of us heard it. Was it working? Was it inhibited; possibly by the '500' EGPWS call? Did it blend in or get overrun by other things happening; like the '500; stable' and 'landing' call outs? Bad timing? This was our first leg on Aircraft X; after picking it up that morning from maintenance inspections in ZZZ1. We know the frequency changed tone was enabled and working from the start and fairly certain it sounded with the change from TRACON to Tower; but we heard no tone subsequently. After parking at the FBO and while setting up for the next leg; we confirmed the tone was enabled and tested it several times. It mostly worked; however at least twice we got no alert tone when swapping frequencies. Then it worked again consistently with no apparent defects. A switchology issue? Intermittent; and failed at a critical time? Another Phenomenon?A few words about situational awareness: As a professional aviator; I take great pride in enhancing and maintaining the highest level of situational awareness possible. I believe my partner shares the same sentiments. After receiving landing clearance; we had no reason to suspect we were tuned to the wrong frequency. But upon reflection afterwards and with the benefit of hindsight; there were 2 aspects that stood out for me that could have (perhaps should have) triggered an awareness that not all was right. Neither was enough to arouse the 'spidey' gut feeling that would have spurred defensive or corrective action; in this case a go-around. As we descended through 500 ft. AGL and approached the runway; I did notice the controller had a male voice; and seemed to be giving some instructions to aircraft on the ground. You will recall the tower controller that cleared us to land minutes earlier; but this was not a red flag for me because one controller relieving another at a position happens all the time. Hearing ground instructions on tower frequency was not a red flag either; because it is not unusual for one controller to be working multiple positions and frequencies simultaneously. One clue I picked up; but failed to realize the significance of; was that I could hear taxiing aircraft respond to ground instructions on the 'tower' frequency. That is unusual. I even remember thinking the controller had an edge on their voice; agitated by something; and that somebody might be in hot water. Now I know why; and who.  The other aspect was the position of the Aircraft Y. Obviously; there is no standard airport; runway; or taxiway layout; and runway hold short lines can be in unexpected locations. Some are marked on airport diagrams; most are not; and some locations are marked inaccurately. Some are deemed Hot Spots. I would say that the runway XX hold short line at [Taxiway] 1X in ZZZ is located in an unusual spot. Its location is not depicted on the Jepp 10-9 chart we use; nor is it marked as a Hot Spot. It is approximately 80-100 yards from the runway XX edge stripe. Although well marked on the ground; the hold short line is difficult; at best; to see in the air from a landing aircraft. As we got closer to the runway; perhaps 100-200 ft AGL; I clearly saw and pointed out the Aircraft Y 'holding short' of runway XX; stationary; and abeam the runway threshold markings. He did appear to be closer than normal to the runway; at an odd angle; but being unfamiliar with that runway/taxiway/hold short configuration; I had no way of knowing that he had actually taxied well past the hold short line; and was; in fact; technically on the runway (for what it's worth; I am certain that no part of his airplane was inside the runway XX edge stripe). Still nothing unusual enough to prompt a go-around. I kept an eye on him and continued the approach. As we passed over the threshold at approximately 50-60 ft. AGL; he was still motionless but I could now see that he was probably past a typical hold short location; and I thought maybe we should report that. Since he wasn't moving; and I was well past him and in the flare; I deemed it safe to complete the landing. As it turned out; there was no need to make that report.As I stated; I work hard at situational awareness and make no excuses for my shortcomings. This was day four of eight for me. I'll never know for certain; but looking back on my previous 3 duty days and rest periods I think it's reasonable to conclude that fatigue played at least a small role in dulling my sense of situational awareness. Although I reported for duty that morning feeling fairly well rested and in a good frame of mind; perhaps I would have perceived and processed these clues as greater threats under different circumstances.Final thoughts: To say the least; this has been a humbling experience. I do my best to guard against complacency; but it is useful to be knocked down a peg or two on occasion; and fortunately this time it happened without loss of life or property. We are human. We can not be perfect; but we can be excellent. I am still working towards that perfect flight.",,"Phenom 300 Flight Crew reported a critical ground conflict during landing after receiving landing clearance.

The aircraft had snow and ice on it because there had been a snowstorm that night.We ran through our preflight; the appropriate checklists; started the engines and taxied to a deicing contractor asked us what service we wanted and I told them to deice the entire aircraft; both the body and the wings. (The clean aircraft concept). At some point; we could not communicate with deicing contractor because their radio stopped working. As a result; we had to communicate with deicing contractor through the FBO; the owners of the deicing contractor.At some point; we were informed that the aircraft deicing was complete and that the aircraft was free and clear of ice and snow.At this point; the first officer wrote down the deicing information that was relayed to him. He and I then inspected the leading edges of our wings as instructed in the deicing manual from the cockpit windows.

I called out the loss of power and immediately set RTOP (Reserve Take Off Power) on Engine Number One. Confirmed Auto Feather was active again and watched Number Two Engine stabilize at 2;200 pounds of torque. At this time we were switched to Approach and due to traffic on Tower I made the switch. Notifications to Approach were made stating call sign; losing Right Engine 'possible Engine Failure.' I was given a heading of 280 and nothing else. I repeated the heading and was met with negative results. I quickly switched to ZZZ Tower and advised engine failure as to now it rolled back to just 1;000 pounds of torque. ZZZ quickly canceled arriving and departing traffic and gave us vectoring and clearance to land. During this situation; the QRH was referenced and a decision was made to keep number two engine on due to the positive thrust it was maintaining. Fuel flow was normal; all appropriate gauges were in the normal range. No fire indications were also observed. While continuing back to ZZZ we also had left engine surges so this confirmed us keeping number two alive due to a possible double engine failure. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) Crews were standing by at ZZZ. We landed safely and taxied to the cargo ramp with ARFF vehicles following. Upon mechanic's inspection they advised that the Number 1 Principal Injector was loose and damaged. Also advised they were changed recently but looked old.

I said thank you and left the frequency again as to not cause any conflict; however where the flight of two had turned was about 1 mile inside of the ZZZ airspace where ZZZ Tower had approved both to make a straight out departure.

By the time I saw the other plane there wasn't time for evasive maneuvers. Afterwards the other pilot asked if we had called being on base or final and we said we had. During the incident it appeared the other aircraft was coming very quick and looking at the ADS-B data; it looks like the other pilot was going a good amount faster than normal for landing as his ground speed was 90 kts.Some things that could have contributed to this was the high amount of traffic both in the pattern as well as the amount of people talking on the same frequency.

The other pilot Person B and his instructor Person C took off right after us and remained in the pattern. I had noticed Person B behind us and greeted him over the radio but received no response. We had successful two-way communication with other aircraft; however. After about 20 minutes; Person A returned to the airport and performed a 45-degree entry into the left downwind leg approximately as Person B was taking off again; Person A had used proper radio calls when approaching the airport; when entering the downwind leg; and when established on the downwind leg.Person A flew the downwind leg; slowed when abeam the approach end to add flaps; and announced his turn to left base at approximately XB00. He had had to extend his downwind leg a bit; however; to allow for landing traffic ahead of us. I was aware of Person B's approximate position from his radio calls announcing departure; crosswind; and downwind ('left' presumed but not declared) and knew that his was a faster aircraft; so I was listening for his next call.At about 40 seconds after Person A's left base announcement; just as Person A was turning and about to announce his turn to final; I heard Person B announce his turn to left base. The timing did not draw a mental picture for me of having taken into account our position; so I announced that we had just turned final and that we were looking for him and that I hoped he was looking for us; which took approximately 10 seconds. As both Person A and I were looking around while also paying attention to maintaining final approach; about 10 seconds later (circa XB01) we saw Person B's plane coming at us from the left side and descending from 50-100 ft. above our altitude. Person A proceeded straight ahead while Person B continued his descent and broke to his right to pass behind and beneath us. It was at this point that I learned that Person B's instructor; Person C; was aboard; as he called me by name to ask if I had called left base. I responded that Person A had indeed done so and that I had followed up announcing that we were looking for [them] as we turned final. I do not recall hearing a response. I made another call stating that it had been a scary event and that I would like to understand how it came about and suggested that we talk on the ground later. That interchange took some 15 seconds; and then I was able to return focus to Person A as he continued his landing.I asked Person A if he was shaken and wanted to turn off or was good to go; and he stated that he was fine and so we continued on to take off.

On vectors to Runway 1 for the Mount Vernon visual; the Crew utilized and decided to switch the approach to RNAV 33 Approach. Potomac Approach gave a descent from 5000 ft. to 4000 ft. and speed of 210 knots. The UP speed was a couple knots below. We were on a 020 degree heading vectors for spacing into the airport. Potomac gave us a left heading 330 to join the localizer for 01. While in heading select; the aircraft rolled into a 30 degree bank turn and the aircraft hit a pocketful moderate turbulence. While in the moderate turbulence; the pitch limit indicator (PLI) instantly came down and the stick shaker momentarily engaged (less than 1 sec). I instantly added power; continued the turn and requested the approach for Runway 33. Proceeded to land without incident.[Suggestions] Changes to AOM.

When we hit the gust; the aircraft speed stayed close to 210; maybe a few knots loss to around the Up Bug speed but the pitch limit indicator (PLI) shot down and the stall buffer speed on the airspeed indicator shot up for about one second. The stick shaker very briefly went off; maybe a shake or two. We flew through the gust and the aircraft returned to normal flying conditions after the Captain increased thrust and the wind calmed. We both agreed we needed to give ourselves a larger margin for airspeed gusts and turbulence and set the flaps to 5. We continued to a visual approach to DCA and landed 33.

Conditions were unrestricted VFR from takeoff to landing; but it was all in the middle of the night. The aircraft had a light load (only 51 passengers; I believe; and not much cargo). This flight was the first of two legs that night; and we had 4 working pilots onboard including myself (total compliment of 2 Captains and 2 First Officers (FO)). The entire flight went without any issues from the moment we pushed back to the moment we shut down engines and opened the door. No one saw anything out of the ordinary and no one heard anything; this includes the Flight Attendants (FA); mechanics; and operations representatives in the cabin. There were no indications from the flight deck that anything had happened during the entire flight. Takeoff was normal and landing was normal. After landing at ZZZZ; the mechanics performed their post-flight inspection and found pretty serious impact damage on the right engine cowling. From the damage; it was clear that we hit something; but no one is sure when it could have happened. Based on the statements made from the rest of the crew and operations representatives; none of us believe that this impact occurred on the ground. It had to have happened somewhere in-flight; but the damage did not seemingly show signs of a bird strike. The theory that made the most sense to all of us was that it was possible we may have hit a drone on takeoff. I had been in OKBK for almost 6 days prior to this flight; and the week was leading up to some big national holiday in the country. During my time outside I did see a lot of drones being flown; so it's possible we may have collided with one; but none of us know for sure. We do strongly believe that it could not have happened on the ground. The operations representatives oversaw loading of the aircraft until the cargo doors were closed on that side of the aircraft; so we do not believe it could have been ground equipment. In OKBK; we taxied from Stand XXX via multiple taxiways; W4 W1 to Runway 33L. All taxiways were plenty wide and there were no possible obstacles that reach that high to cause such damage. At ZZZZ we landed on Runway XXR and taxied to the main ramp and we were watched the entire time.

Oil temperature; oil pressure; fuel flow; everything was normal outside of the engine vibration. Since the engine vibration was still in the yellow; we decided to reach out to dispatch and maintenance. Since all engine conditions were normal outside of just the vibration; I didn't see fit to declare an emergency and dispatch wanted us to divert to ZZZ1. On top of the engine indications being normal outside of the vibration on the descent when power is at idle for more than 5 seconds we were able to get the vibration down to 1.9 or 1.8 in the green.

Seconds later; the EICAS indicated HYD 2 LO QTY along with the associated messages. The aircraft was fully configured with flaps set at 5 and the gear already down and locked. A quick look at the hydraulic synoptic page confirmed system #2 quantity indicated zero. Realizing the QRH called for a lengthy checklist procedure and knowing the loss of inboard brakes; nose wheel steering; engine 2 thrust reverser; amongst other components; coupled with thunderstorms in the area; I was not enthusiastic about breaking off the landing only to run multiple checklists. I made the judgement call to land seeing as we were within 1;000 feet AGL at this point. I was aware of longer landing distance and what the QRH procedures entailed. My FO did an excellent job of quickly running through the appropriate checklists even though I chose not to 'run' the checklists formally. I knew the runway was plenty long enough (9;000 feet) and I landed the jet and managed to stop with plenty of runway left. In fact; I was able to exit the runway at the high speed taxiway. We were able to cross XXC on Taxiway 1; and I taxied up Taxiway 2 and; as luck would have it; only needed a 'half left' turn to get into [the gate]. As a result; I felt comfortable using differential braking and differential minimum thrust to get the jet to the gate; despite the loss of nose wheel steering. In essence; the consequence of going around; not being unable to have a normal gear retraction; weather in the area; being familiar with the loss of hydraulics; my FO (First Officer) ensuring a quick glance to run and review the actual QRH; already being configured; etc.;--all led me to make the call to land the jet. We simply did not have the luxury; in my opinion; of notifying the tower; the flight attendants; recalculating flaps full landing speeds; etc. Getting on the ground seemed the right call. It appeared on the post flight inspection that some brake line on the left main gear had given way though we were unable to know for sure if that was what did the trick. I notified maintenance control after deplaning without further issues. The jet was done for the night and maintenance control advised me that they would address the issue overnight.",,"About 500 ft. on short final to ZZZ. HYD 2 Low Pressure EICAS.

Upon arrival; I made contact with the on-scene officers as well as a K-9 unit. Once advised that K-9 was going to begin tracking I began to set up my issued drone for operation to further assist. It should be noted; although the weather report called for fog in the area; the immediate are where we were to be working was clear of fog and I observed a clear ceiling estimated at 200 feet for operation. After obtaining the drone; loading batteries; activating the power up sequence and placing it on the ground I obtained the remote and began the same. Once the remote was powered up and a connection was made with the drone; I began to check its other statuses (gimbal and compass calibrations; GPS stabilization and satellite connections) to ensure it was ready for flight. It was during this time I noted the calibrations were showing connected and receiving great reception; the GPS was illuminated in green (indicating it was connected) and the satellite connection was showing connectivity to 14 satellites. I did not note any discrepancies on or about the drone and began to activate it. Once the remote activated the drone; I began to elevate it to about 10 feet to continue with pre-mission operation checks of the spin and horizontal tests. As the drone began to elevate to the required height; I noted the props of the drone began to accelerate to an abnormal speed. As I began to give the drone commands via the remote to conduct the spin and horizontal checks; I noted an abnormal rattling sound emitting from the drone. It was at this moment I began to give the drone commands via the remote to land. As this occurred; I observed the drone fail to land and it rather began to ascend in altitude (to about 100 feet). As the drone was ascending; I continued to give the drone commands to return to home and land. The drone began to respond and lower its altitude; however; it began to fight the landing orders and began to rapidly ascend a second time upward. I again began to gain control of the drone and bring it down to land. As I continued to hold the remote stick down to bring it back to land; I noted it was traveling downward at an accelerated rate. I began to try and slow the drone by lifting the stick; however; the drone did not respond in a positive fashion. The drone continued to lower itself in a quick fashion until the bottom of the drone struck the left A-pillar of a nearby parked vehicle. The drone vaulted itself from the vehicle; causing it to land up-side-down upon the asphalt parking lot. As I responded to recover the drone; I noted the left front arm had sustained damage as it was broken in half. Several other props had been damaged as well; to include the front right landing leg. After recovering the drone; I began to inspect the above described vehicle. During this inspection I did note a small crack (BB-like impression) upon the lower left corner of the wind shield. I was able to make contact with the owner of the vehicle who confirmed that this crack was pre-existing. No other damage was noted at this time. Both the drone and the vehicle were photographed. At this time; I believe that the GPS stabilization system was not fully activated and when the drone was elevated it went into a system failure mode; thus causing the drone to climb to a safe 'return to home' altitude. It is unknown why the drone proceeded to land at such a high rate of speed and struck the vehicle.",,,,"Government UAS pilot reported they lost control of the UAS after launch.

As I was descending; I repeatedly attempted to turn on the runway lights by keying UNICOM. I could clearly see the PAPI lights and the ramp to the left of the runway as well as the very well lit sports fields to the right of the runway; but I could not get the runway lights to come on. I made my approach; but preferred not to land on the unlit runway; so I executed a go-around.I made an additional attempt to key on the lights to no avail. In the downwind leg; I heard a pop in my headset as the low voltage light illuminated on the panel. I switched on my backup alternator; switched batteries; and determined I did not want to be airborne without electrical power; so I elected to proceed with the landing in spite of the apparently non-functional runway lights.I carried too much energy into the landing and floated more than is typical. I may have bounced; but ultimately touched down and began braking. I soon realized that my braking authority was poor as the runway was wet. I rolled out all the way to the end of the runway and made a turn toward the taxiway; but the aircraft skidded as I initiated the turn.The aircraft is undamaged and did not leave the pavement; but I felt a substantial bump as the aircraft turned toward the ramp and I believe the tire on the right main gear rolled over a single runway end light.I knew I was carrying too much speed and I should have rejected the landing; but I let my concern about the potential electrical issue push me into forcing the plane onto the ground. I may have better managed both approaches for landing if I had been able to activate the runway lights.",,,,"M-20 pilot reported runway excursion during landing rollout.",

I was pilot flying (PF) and the Captain was pilot monitoring (PM). We had planned for the ILS Runway XXC approach but entering the terminal area we were given clearance for approach for Runway X. We asked for Runway XXC approach but due to outbound traffic off of Runway XYC ZZZ Tower was unable to accommodate the request so we had now set up for Runway X approach. I had the Captain brief the approach as pilot monitoring while I was flying the aircraft. On the downwind I started slowing to Flaps Up clean Speed and called for Flaps 1 and then started slowing to Flaps 1 speed. The Approach Controller then cleared us to descend to 3;500 ft. and the pilot monitoring asked if I would like an extension off of ZZZZZ which is the Final Approach Fix for Runway X into ZZZ. I said yes I would like a Course Fix Intercept off of ZZZZZ for the ILS Runway X. Approach Control then turned us off of downwind on an intercept heading to intercept the Localizer for Runway X and at that point I called for Flaps 5 and started to slow to Flaps 5 speed. Then Approach Controller asked us if we had the runway in sight; at which I did tell the pilot monitoring affirmative I have the runway in sight. We were given clearance for the Visual Approach for Runway X but I still continued to use Localizer and Glide Slope Guidance to fly the approach. Upon intercepting the final approach course just outside of ZZZZZ as glide slope was alive I called for Gear Down and Flaps 20 and at that point the Localizer captured. Not too long after that the Glide Slope captured and I set 3;000 ft. for the Missed Approach altitude in the altitude window and we both pointed and called '3;000' set. I called for Flaps 30 and landing checklist at which point the pilot monitoring set Flaps 30 and I set my Vref Approach Speed plus the wind additive for Flaps 30 and we accomplished the Landing Checklist. Once we passed ZZZZZ and 'ZZZZZ 2400' was called I continued to fly by use of Autopilot and Auto Throttle down to the 'STABLE CALL OUT' at 1000 ft. AFE (Above Field Elevation). It was at that point approaching the Stable Call Out that the EICAS Message 'LE SLAT DISAGREE' appeared and we received the Master Caution Alert. I did call for QRH Non-Normal LE EDGE SLAT DISAGREE checklist but since we were inside of 1;000 ft. and with runway insight the pilot monitoring which was also the Captain decided that we will continue to landing and to increase our Vref speed. At that point I recall that I was flying target at 135 KIAS and increased to 140 KIAS. One final thing that the pilot monitoring did try to do was to change flap setting from 30 to 25 and then back to 30 to see if would reset and remove the message which it did not and we ended up touching down at a faster speed. The winds also on final approach when the flaps were called to be placed flaps 30 after passing ZZZZZ I noticed on my Multifunction Flight Display (MFD) were a direct crosswind from the right at 38 kts. but did start to diminish down to almost 10 kts. at touchdown. Once we touched down the Call Outs of 'Speedbrake UP' and 'Reversers Normal we're made by the Captain and once we slowed to 80 kts.; the Captain took over controls and we made an exit right turn off of Runway X onto X. We were given instructions by Tower to taxi on Taxiway 1 to Spot XX and then contact Company Ramp Control for Ramp entrance. The Captain called for 'Flaps Up' after landing sequence and I performed the necessary steps; but realizing myself that I should've kept the Flaps down since the EICAS Message did not clear. The Flaps retracted and stopped at Flaps 1 and stayed that way. Once we were given clearance to enter Company Ramp and parking; we entered and parked at our assigned parking spot and then performed the necessary steps to shutdown the aircraft. Once complete the Captain called for the Shutdown checklist and that was performed. Once I was given instructions to open the door I went and opened the door and then returned to my seat and we performed the Secure Checklist procedures and secured the aircraft. I then got out of my seat. To check to see if the Ramp Crew had placed the chocks in the correct place in which they did. I notified the Captain that the chocks were in place and he released the parking brake. Once I had gathered my stuff and exited the aircraft to the bottom of the stairs. I performed a thorough walk around post-flight inspection of the aircraft and that's when I noticed that the slats were still out and had not retracted and upon further review noticed that the Right Inboard Slats were both bent beyond the rivets holding them. The Captain had also came out to that area and saw the same thing. The Captain had also wrote in the aircraft maintenance logbook a full right up of the EICAS message. There was no Maintenance Personnel in the vicinity when we arrived but we both explained to the Company Service Representative what had happened and the steps that we performed so that he could pass that along to maintenance. We both left the aircraft and went to the Facility Building and then left separately. Not sure of why we received a LE SLAT DISAGREE Message being that it was close to touchdown and the flaps had been extending normally throughout the approach until that point below 1;000 ft. AFE.Should have not retracted the flaps after exiting the runway and should've left the flaps down in their Flaps 30 position.",,,,"B767 First Officer reported a LE SLAT DISAGREE message and a master caution alert on final approach.

Captain was informed by Maintenance that the following items failed at Cruise.Autoflight System (AFS): FMGC2 64 AFS 1 Electronic Instrument System (EIS) 2; IR2; IR3; IR1; EIS1AFS: FMGC1 61. AFS 1 IR3; IR1; EIS1; EiS2 IR2CAB PR LDG ELEV FAULTFMGC2 (1CA2) BUS FM2/DMC2 (1WT2). EIS2The above failures began at 28;000 ft. approximately 150-180 miles from ZZZZ. The first indication of any problem was an auditory triple click; followed by GPS Primary lost on both the Captain and First Officer's (FO's) displays. What followed next was an ECAM action to set manual field elevation. I was Pilot Flying and verbalized my aircraft; my radios. At the same time Captain began to run the ECAM actions.Following ECAM actions; it was evident that we were having navigation issues. The primary flight plan and secondary flight plans were gone. While the Captain with his 19 years of Airbus experience worked diligently to re-establish a flight plan; I let ATC know of our issues and requested vectors and a lower altitude.The Captain was able to establish a partial flight plan with ZZZZ as our destination. This allowed points and altitudes to appear back in our MFD. However the aircraft would not manage to any point; any altitude or airspeed. Thus resulting in using HDG; open Decent and manual speeds for the remainder of the arrival and approach.Not being able to arm an approach in either AP1 (Autopilot 1); or AP2 (Autopilot 2) a visual approach to landing was preformed. Approaching 500 ft. from touchdown with 1;100 ft. down on the VSI; Captain calmly said 'What do you think about a go around'? I said that sounds like a good idea your call. We did the go around according to the new procedures without event. After vectors for a downwind and base back to Runway XX and fully aware of the aircraft capabilities or lack thereof a visual approach was flown and successfully landed on Runway XX; making the high speed taxi way of X.The successful completion of the flight was made easier by the training received and the adherence to the SOP's established by company. The Captain set expectations the very first time I met him in ZZZ for the start of the sequence. These expectations along with good CRM and the experience of the Captain aided in the successful outcome of the flight. I believe that this was a computer failure in nature.",,"Kudos to Person A. For a probationary pilot to focus on what he was taught to do during training made this a non event. His CRM and flying skills made the events that unfolded seem like a normal flight with 2 FMGCs; 2 Electronic Instrument Systems (EISs) and 3 Inertial Reference Unit (IRU) failures. Despite these issues; he continued to make every altitude and airspeed restriction on the arrival. His CRM skills were timely and spot on. Recognizing we were unstable and deciding to go around showed his situational awareness.The second approach was a visual pattern with ATC assistance. The skills he obtained in training made this hand flown approach the success that it was.We were at 28;000 ft. roughly 180 miles (?) from ZZZZ. It was a beautiful VMC day. The dry riverbed's luminescence perfectly pointed us to the field the closer we proceeded to land.My first recollection was an auditory triple click noting system downgrade. Checking the Flight Management Advisory; FMA; I saw 'HEADING' displayed. We tried to push the Navigation button without success. Switching Autopilots multiple times lead to the same result. Person A was the Pilot Flying; PF; and I was the Pilot Monitoring; PM. The next item we verbalized was 'GPS' in the scratchpad of the Multi-functional Control Display Unit; MCDU. Finally the first and only Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring; ECAM; was to set the destination elevation. 'My aircraft' said the PM. I set the field elevation from my 10-9 page roughly 300 ft. and selected manual. Our next issue was 'set offside range'. From experience; I knew an FMGC had failed. We coordinated ranges all the way from top of descent to final approach segment.I looked down to see the flight plan was gone and only Present Position; PPOS was displayed. I flipped back and forth between the primary and secondary flight plans and noticed the secondary Line Select Key Right One; LSK R1; showing INIT. I typed in ZZZZ/ZZZZ and actually got a destination. Once a flight plan was built; I activated the secondary. This allowed me to go back to auto for the Cabin Pressure Controller. I verified the field elevation was good and it worked like normal.During this evolution; Person A confessed to ATC we were having navigation issues. He was getting headings and descents. We were cleared to intercept a radial but couldn't. We got some directs at this point but the plane would not allow us to manage the descent. Due to only having open descent available; we set the bottom of each restriction even though we were cleared lower. We hadn't gotten ATIS due to the distance. I obtained the current ATIS and reset the performance page. I made a simple cabin PA and did not advise the flight attendants or passengers of our situation as I felt there was no need to invoke pandemonium. The airplane was flying and operating normal with minor peculiarities that we kept dealing with. We ran the descent checklist on time. We prepared the cabin; activated the approach; did landing lights and sterile all per the FOM.ATC did an excellent job of vectors and altitudes to set us up for the VOR 2 Runway XX. It took a few times to get what we wanted but persistence paid off. Once we were cleared to intercept the VOR the airplane showed 'SPECIF VOR/D UNAVAIL'. I have never seen this display in 19 years on the Airbus. PF could not Arm the approach! We also tried to manage the speed and it would not arm. The perf page showed no approach speeds. These distractions pushed us to the high side of the VASI.Approaching 1;000 ft. we were stable but were three white one red on the VASI. Person A was trying his best to correct without exceeding 1;000 ft. per minute. Somewhere below five hundred feet I saw 1;100 down on the VASI. I calmly said; 'What do you think about a go Around'? Person A calmly replied 'Yeah; that's a good idea'. We did the Go Around according to the new procedures. Because the approach had not been armed we did not set the Missed ApproachAltitude. On the new go around procedure we caught this threat! We had practiced this on each descent brief the previous two briefs and I feel this helped slow down an already bad situation. The go around allowed is to regroup and be better prepared for the nuances of the second approach. Person A had selected 185 kts. on the go. This was actually good in that we climbed quicker and yet were ahead of the airplane. We stayed at flaps one in the pattern as we discussed the upcoming approach. We ran a descent checklist and a before landing checklist like the first approach.We landed long because we were fast due to a bugged speed verses a managed speed. We had no reference speeds so we set VLS plus 5 which is typically what I have seen. In the uniqueness of the situation we had selected medium auto brakes which I feel was significant to a successful outcome. I verbalized 'Full Reverser' to which Person A did per the SOP.Keys to our success:The day one brief helped set the tone for Person A to give inputs in the cockpit. We talked about our expectations of each other to mitigate mistakes. Procedures were written to help us get through this unique scenario.Training makes us fly a hand flown approach in the simulator. Person A showed his comfort with this when he stated 'Flight Directors off give me the bird' on final. The simulator pilots did their job well!Standardized procedures cut out any guess work between the two of us. My expectations while in the heat of the battle were met by Person A doing things the company trained way.Person A briefed the approach at 250 miles. Had we not done our briefing early; we could easily have gotten behind the plane. The familiarity with the points in the arrival and final helped us when the secondary flight plan was rebuilt and activated.This could happen again. Would love to see this scenario built for [future] training.",,"Flight Crew reported failures of numerous systems in cruise. The crew ran the QRH and check lists and reconstructed a flight plan and continued to destination airport. A go around was performed and the approach was accomplished again; allowing for a safe landing at destination airport.",

Ground cleared us to [parking via Taxiway 1]. Approaching [parking]; Ramp cleared us to the gate via the left-side. Since we were preemptive with our communication to Ground and Ramp; we needed to slow their aircraft's taxi speed. As we approached the non-movement area threshold; a baggage truck converged with the aircraft from the right (driving east to west along the non-movement area line). The left-seat pilot cleared the aircraft's left side; and I cleared the right; noticing that the baggage truck wasn't slowing. Realizing that the baggage truck wouldn't yield to the aircraft; I instructed the left-seat pilot; 'Hold.' It didn't register immediately; requiring me to say it twice more. The left-seat pilot seat placed the thrust levers to idle and applied the brakes forcefully; prompted by the urgency in my voice; and I turned off the taxi light. The baggage truck passed in front of the nose (underneath from our perspective in the cockpit) so close that we had to sit up to see him. This was the first time the left-seat pilot had been able to visually acquire the baggage truck driver; who then made a right turn to travel parallel to the left-side line and the gates and disappeared into the terminal. The driver seemed unaware of the aircraft's motion and proximity. We would have struck it or worse if we had been two seconds delayed in noticing the baggage truck and/or stopping the aircraft. The driver hazarded the baggage truck; his/her/their own life; and the aircraft.A lack of situational awareness on the part of the baggage truck operator. The aircraft was in motion with the taxi light on; and the operator was looking straight ahead and didn't seem distracted nor did he/she/they demonstrate any sort of recognition or care for his/her/their misjudgment when the aircraft came to a sudden stop.Safety is paramount and getting runover is tragic...and avoidable. Ground personnel must maintain their situational awareness.

By the FAF for Runway 16R (using ILS Runway 16R as a backup for a visual) we received an RA while traffic was no factor my FO began the 'climb' commanded by the TCAS which switched to a TCAS RA 'descend'. During the descent the TCAS advised clear of conflict when the airplane was 800 ft. AGL. Given our configuration; energy state; and the startle and surprise response from the FO; I determined that we were unstable and that we should discontinue the approach.  I took over controls and began a go around to 2000 ft. straight ahead and requested a new visual approach. Landed without event and debriefed the event. The FO was too nervous and hyper focused. Their initial response was to follow the RA even though we had traffic in sight. FO did not consider how close the airplane was to the ground regardless of the RA.

We started both engines and taxied to Runway XXR. All check list and engine warmup time's completed. Takeoff roll was normal. After the gear was retracted we notice number two engine oil level was low and started blinking. Shortly after we noticed the white advisory message advising us of the oil. We discussed contacting maintenance once we passed 10;000 ft. And see what they had to say. Climbing out of 4;000 ft. We received violent bangs followed by massive yawing of the aircraft indicative of an engine failure. I immediately leveled the aircraft to get more airflow into the engine. At this point the number one engine had at least 3-5 massive compressor stalls followed by a rollback. My first officer (FO); who did an amazing job; advised ATC and started the ECAM procedures. We had numerous ECAM messages going off and of course flight attendants calling us nonstop due to the flames coming out of number one engine; rightfully so. I immediately started the APU and turned back towards ZZZ. The number two engine was still low on oil so my FO and I discussed the contingency for that situation as well. Once we leveled off; I started a slow decent with reduced power on number one. The compressor stalls stopped but the engine was running hot. Once we had every checklist completed and all the proper company stations called. We decided to make an overweight landing. On final we saw all the Crash Fire Rescue (CFR) was waiting for us. After completing all normal checklists; Fight Attendant briefing; passenger announcements and abnormal checklists; we felt it was time to land. We had plenty of fuel and a lot of time to make sure things were done correctly. Our aircraft weight was around 149;900 pounds when we touched down. We stopped the aircraft in the runway and called flight attended stations. CFR looked us over and noticed our brakes were pretty hot; but did not notice any engine damage or fire on the affected side. CFR told us to shut down both engines on the runway. After inspection I called over the PA to remain seated. We started number two and taxied to the gate with CFR in tow. No further actions were taken.",,,,"A320 Captain reported compressor stalls; engine rollback; and failure of the number one engine while climbing through 4;000 ft. just after departure.

Both Aircraft X and Aircraft Y checked in as '[priority handling] aircraft' descending from FL400 'bingo fuel' from the Warning Areas well above and east of my airspace. I asked them to IDENT - then; I contacted ZZZ3 to ask if they had any prior comms with Aircraft X or Aircraft Y; which they responded negative. I then contacted the ZZZ4 sector of ZZZ5 to ask if they had any information on the traffic; to which they responded they had taken a point out from ZZZ3 on both.My supervisor; not certified on the position I was working; nor the position between where I was working and the airspace these aircraft were coming from; sat down next to me to monitor the situation but had to ask the sector beside me to coordinate for me because they were unequipped to complete the coordination. The supervisor was only there to write down the information: SOB (Souls on Board); fuel remaining. I continued to work the traffic in my airspace; including breaking one aircraft off a cleared approach due to the inbound [priority handling] aircraft. I was able to radar identify the first aircraft because they were squawking 7700 and IDENT-ing when instructed. I had to instruct the other aircraft to squawk 7700 so I could positively radar identify them as both were still well above and outside my airspace; outside my STARS filter limits. Both aircraft were pointed out to the adjacent ZZZ6 Approach sector; vectored to ZZZ1 for the visual approach Runway XX. Both aircraft were safe on deck shortly after. To my knowledge I did everything in my power to complete all coordination; provide positive control; and handle the unexpected and rapid event in accordance with 7110.65.

[We] requested a climb to FL380 per the flight plan and were cleared by ATC to climb from FL340 to FL380 after the opposite direction traffic had passed by on the right side (west of our track; distance unknown). The light level outside was dusk and the aircraft above and to the right was not producing contrails. Winds were out of the west at 100 kts. No turbulence had been encountered at cruise and the fasten seat belt sign was off. Shortly after the CA (PF) (Captain Pilot Flying) initiated the climb; the aircraft rolled to the left approximately 30 degrees and shook violently from the encounter. The PF disengaged the autopilot; rolled back to wings level; and re-engaged the autopilot to continue the climb. No 'bank angle; bank angle' aural alert occurred. The FO (PM) (First Officer Pilot Monitoring) turned on the fasten seat belt sign and instructed the Flight Attendants over the PA:  'Flight Attendants; take your seats.' (The FO did not use standard phraseology for a turbulence encounter due to the startle effect). The encounter lasted for less than 5 seconds. No deviation from the cleared routing or altitude was noted as the CA was quickly able to regain control of the aircraft. The CA transferred aircraft control and radios to the FO while the CA had the flight attendants check in. Upon check in; the CA learned that a passenger waiting to use the aft lavatory fell into the cover for the escape slide at 2R and twisted her right knee/leg. The CA contacted Dispatch for a discrete frequency and then Medlink to discuss treatment options. In the course of determining the extent of the passenger's injuries; the CA offered diversion to the passenger which the passenger declined. Medlink recommended a cold compress and three acetaminophen tablets from the medical kit. The flight attendants had already applied the cold compress but the passenger refused the acetaminophen. The CA and FO determined the turbulence would have been classified as severe. Since the aircraft was flying normally; there was no concern of structural damage from the short duration event. Nothing other than normal Gs were sensed by the flight deck crew. No turbulence from the event was displayed on [display]. We discussed whether we should request priority handling or declare an emergency. The CA and FO determined the best course of action; based on Medlink's assessment of the injuries and recommendations; was to continue to the destination and have EMTs meet the aircraft at the gate. Normal checklists were completed for the descent and arrival into ZZZ1. We were already flying at a high cost index so we were flying at the fastest speed for the arrival into ZZZ1. ATIS was calling for arrivals to XXL. We requested and were granted to fly an approach to Runway XXR after a brief explanation to ATC. Runway XXR had a shorter taxi distance to the ramp and fewer turns to our gate. After an uneventful landing; the CA taxied as fast as practical to arrive at the gate quickly.

The First Officer was pilot flying level at FL190 just before beginning our descent on the arrival.We were approaching the ZZZZZ1 Intersection and I was heads down in the airplane trying to get the ATIS/in-range gate information. I heard the FO (First Officer) make a statement 'like what is going on/what is that.' Moments after that I heard the autopilot disconnect and shortly after that the airplane was banking to the left. I looked at the EICAS screens to see if any messages had appeared that would have caused the autopilot to disconnect as it happened quite suddenly. The First Officer announced he had disconnected the autopilot and my attention was then directed outside. As I looked outside I could clearly see a large white round balloon with some orange coloring on the bottom that looked to have a cable connected possibly to the ground. The object was heading straight for the nose/windshield area and it was very close to making contact with the aircraft and I am convinced had the First Officer not acted as swiftly as he did by banking the aircraft; we would have made contact with the object.After the evasive maneuver the First Officer got the aircraft back on the arrival and we reengaged the autopilot. The event lasted only a few seconds. I was able to inform ATC that we had almost impacted a weather balloon. ATC gathered a little information on the report; altitude and location; and replied with "those things are supposed to have transponders." After the event we proceeded to a normal landing in ZZZ.Weather balloon that I believe was not supposed to be at that altitude caused us to have to make an evasive maneuver to avoid impacting it.",,"While in cruise at filed FL190 from ZZZ1 to ZZZ; nearing the TOD (Top of Descent) for the ZZZZZ RNAV Arrival; assigned 310 kt. or faster; we were cruising at 320 kt. between ZZZZZ2 and ZZZZZ1. Autopilot was engaged and I was pilot flying when an object came into view in my peripheral vision. As I glanced up at it; I took about a second to process what I was seeing as an object in our flight path that was either stationary or on a collision course with the aircraft. I processed that it was a white and orange checkered weather balloon with equipment hanging underneath; and then promptly disconnected the autopilot and quickly initiated a left bank of roughly 20 to 30 degrees - cannot recall as it happened so fast. I think I initiated the bank within one or two seconds of first seeing the balloon. The balloon went by the right side of the aircraft and did not appear to have come in contact with us; but we were not certain about that. Without knowing the exact size of the balloon; I can estimate it maybe came within 20 to 30 ft. of the right wing.Once clear; I reduced the bank and got the aircraft back on course and re-engaged the autopilot. During the maneuver; altitude reached FL191. The Captain reported the balloon's location to ATC; and they had no idea that there was a balloon in the vicinity of the arrival. As I saw the balloon first; the Captain said he saw it after I verbally exclaimed profanity as I disconnected the autopilot and banked the aircraft. An aircraft behind us also at FL190 did not encounter the balloon after being warned by ATC from our report. The Captain called the flight attendants to check on the cabin. At the time the seatbelt sign was on and no passengers were out of their seats. The forward FA (Flight Attendant) was out of her seat in the cabin but did not fall or receive any injuries; and the aft FA was seated at the time of the maneuver. Had I not promptly changed the flight path; the aircraft would have gone directly into the balloon or the equipment hanging underneath. After the event; we continued as normal to land in ZZZ. The Captain made a PA to the passengers at the gate before we opened the door to explain the reason for the maneuver. An FA who was a deadhead in the back claimed that she saw the balloon off the right side as we maneuvered to avoid it. The balloon looked like a roughly 10x10 ft. weather balloon or maybe larger; white and orange color on the balloon itself with a box of equipment hanging below it. Additionally; once on the ground we had Maintenance conduct a post-flight inspection for any damage if we had contacted it.The cause of this incident was an un-tracked weather balloon on the ZZZZZ Arrival directly in our fight path at FL190. ATC said they could not detect a transponder from it. It may have been a recreational weather balloon. Had I seen it earlier I'm not sure it would have bought us much more time to avoid it as it came up so fast; being that it was stationary relative to us at 320 kt.

I was unable to make visual contact with the traffic and as we started the right climbing turn on the departure procedure; we received a TA. I attempted to visually acquire traffic however was unable to visually see the traffic.  Immediately after the TA; while still in the right-hand climbing turn; we received a CLIMB RA. I increased the pitch to follow the RA and during the pitch increase we received a stick shaker that lasted approximately 2 seconds. I slowly lowered the nose to recover from stick shaker. At this point; I still did not have traffic so continued with the CLIMB RA.

After holding short; Ground Control instructed the flight crew to cross Runway 26R at Taxiway D and hold short of Runway 26 left (L) at Taxiway D. After crossing the centerline of Runway 26R; the Pilot Flying began slowing the taxi speed of the aircraft as it approached the far side of the Runway.

The Runway Holding Position Marking at this location was faded; dirty; and difficult to identify.

After the jet notified ATC of the near miss; the controller apologized and mentioned that he had lost track of the traffic while it passed in front of the Tower. After; continued onto [Taxiway] XY after the traffic moved away; and parked on the student ramp without issue.Overall; there were a number of factors that led to this problem. The fact that I thought the traffic had exited on [Taxiway] XX; along with confirmation bias from the controller's instructions that did not say to give way; led me to believe there wouldn't be any traffic coming from my left. This; compounded with the fact that it was night and this portion of the airport wasn't well lit; led to my failure to see the traffic before continuing to taxi.

Miami departure gave us a heading; then direct to an intersection. As Pilot Monitoring I was working the radios and programming the FMGC. I believe the controller spelled the intersection out as JONEZ. I read it back spelling it out phonetically as JONEZ. The controller was busy and did not acknowledge or correct me; she already moved on to issuing instructions to other aircraft. I took that to mean the read back was correct and after confirming with the FO who was Pilot Flying I hit direct JONEZ. That intersection was also directly ahead of us so it seemed correct. After about 30 seconds the controller asked if we were direct to the intersection and I stated that we were. She answered that it didn't look like it; proceed direct HROCK intersection instead.While doing that I realized that there was a JOENZ intersection on the departure which was probably where we were supposed to have gone initially. We navigated to HROCK intersection and completed the departure uneventfully. To my hearing it sounded like the controller spelled the intersection out as JONEZ; though I could be wrong. If I had looked on the flight plan for the intersection I would have seen JOENZ instead of JONEZ and queried her. As it turned out I read JONEZ back phonetically and the controller either was too busy to correct me or believed I read it back correctly; so I typed it into the scratch pad and hit 'Direct to' after confirming with my FO who also agreed with the spelling. The fact that JONEZ was directly in front of us further added to the assumption that it was correct. In the future when being given clearance to an intersection; even if it's being spelled out; I'll quickly scroll through the flight plan to see if it is already on our route before simply typing it in.",,,,"Pilot reported a track deviation resulting from confusion regarding similar sounding fix names; JOENZ and JONEZ; while departing on the HROCK1 SID from FLL.",

Reviewing and decoding NOTAMs is a slow and time consuming process. All of it is in code developed generations ago. Since there is insufficient time to fully review NOTAMs; weather; aircraft maintenance status; operational issues and a variety of other information in the hour between company show time and pushback from the gate; my practice is to review NOTAMs and weather from home the night before the trip and again in the morning before I drive to work. For this trip; one of the many (73) NOTAMs applied to LAS follows. !LAS 01/104 LAS OBST TOWER LGT (ASR 1200185) 360421.50N1151201.20W (2.4NM W LAS) 2357.0FT (60.0FT AGL) U/S 2301201520-2304200500This NOTAM highlights a key failing of the FAA's NOTAM system. For all of the emphasis in the last decade on SMS; and the application of risk and threat assessments to operations; the NOTAM system remains nevertheless not classified by risk. I understand that a helicopter pilot may see this NOTAM as important; but there is no threat to my flight from an unlighted tower 2.4 miles west of the airport at 60 feet. To put that in perspective; the tail of my aircraft stands 40 feet high; and to get to that tower; I would first have to fly through the Las Vegas Strip where buildings stand hundreds of feet high just west of the runway complex.Typically; the printed flight paperwork for my flights ranges between 30 and sometimes over 80 pages in length. If each page was taped end to end; that equates to approximately 30 to 80 linear feet of information that the PIC must absorb and apply; in accordance with 91.103 - all of it in the form of code - just for one flight segment. NOTAMs are a large portion of that information. Yet; I must review all of it in an effort to sort through those NOTAMs which may or may not be applicable to my flight; and determine the relative risk or threat of each. And I have to do this for each and every flight segment. Today's trip includes 4 flight segments; with potentially 200+ pages of preflight information. Oh; and I still see the 3/4 page long Disneyland NOTAM in every preflight package; which has been in place since 9/11. The true threat is not the 60 foot tower 2.4 miles from the airport; but the un-assessed and unfiltered volume of coded information which is overwhelming our system. From a human factors perspective; pilots will 1) make mistakes in reviewing large volumes of NOTAM information; missing key items; 2) become complacent when continuously bombarded with NOTAMs; and fail to conscientiously study them; and 3) error in assessing the relative applicability and threat of one versus another.The technology exists to fix this. Industry vendors (WSI; Foreflight; Jeppesen; and others) have built tools for decoding and presenting NOTAMs in graphics; for streamlining the distribution of NOTAMs; and in the case of Jeppesen; narrowing the scope of NOTAMs to the procedures applicable to a flight. Yet; the FAA has not developed a standard for categorizing NOTAMs by risk or applicability. Moreover; company policy establishes that the only authorized NOTAM method is the un-decoded FAA format delivered in the flight paperwork.Recommendations as follows. Gather internal company data relative to NOTAM-related events. Formally advise the pilot group and dispatchers that the company is seeking to understand the threat of NOTAMs to our operation; and prepare for them a dedicated form in [our company notification system] for specifically capturing events related to NOTAM issues. Seek FAA approval and formally adopt and incorporate in the company policy that the Jeppesen Flight Deck Pro or some other tool for NOTAM organization and presentation be approved for flight crew use.In coordination with [an industry advocacy group]; submit a request that the ASIAS IAT conduct a directed study of available FUSION data to characterize and evaluate the risk to the industry due to the deficiencies of the current NOTAM system. Focus on the two deficiencies detailed in this report.  NOTAMs are not ranked by relative risk; and  NOTAMs are not filtered by applicability to a flight or operation. Encourage the ASIAS IAT to emphasize NOTAM risk at the fall 2023 InfoShare; in order to motivate the industry to collaborate on understanding the risk and developing new tools and methods.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported a recent flight departing LAS included 73 NOTAMs of which many did not apply to their flight.

They said that it was something that was not unusual. The battery was in a protective molded housing that was obviously designed for the particular device with unexposed terminals.During our phone conversation; I referenced the GOM and Company's Dangerous Goods Table. There are three table entries for batteries in general and another five entries for mobility aids.

The tug was completely blocked for the First Officer (FO) to see because of the location and I did not see it until it came out from behind the post between my side windows. We were probably 40-50 ft. from the road and I as soon as I had a visual on the errant tug I aggressively applied the brakes. The tug never saw us until they were in about the 11 o'clock position to our nose and they momentarily turned away then continued to drive off. Had I not stopped the airplane would have impacted the tug. We stopped about maybe 10 ft. away; still clear of the road. I could see the top of the tug the entire time. I then set the brake and the FO and I evaluated the situation with a quick discussion and to see how each other was doing. The FO contacted Ground to report the tug as I contacted the FAs to ensure everyone was okay. Everyone was Okay and I was informed that during the aggressive stop everyone was seated; including the FAs; with seat belts on. I then made a brief PA to the Passengers. After about 10 minutes we had resolved the situation and were confident to continue to taxi. In cruise we received a call from the FAs saying the passenger in seat XX was complaining of a sore and stiff neck associated with an aggressive stop of the aircraft to avoid a tug that blew through a stop sign at ZZZ.

We departed the ramp with no further incidents and had a normal flight. The ramp personnel at the FBO should never have asked the helicopter pilot of to do what it did.

I set the altitude to 1600 ft. planning to join final just outside ZZZZZ. The visibility was being reported 10 SM and the cloud layer at maybe 10000 ft. I had briefed the visual; backed up with the ILS. I was delaying the base turn; kind of self vectoring; with the plan to capture the LOC before the GS. I think I had initiated the base turn and was thinking that I was uncomfortable with the descent rate. I didn't want to divert my attention away from the level off (i.e. by reaching up/looking up to manage the Flight Control Unit (FCU) as we were rapidly approaching 1600 ft.; I disconnected the Autopilot to manually fly the level off. In these moments we got the EGPWS Caution/Warnings. The EGPWS recovery actions & callouts did not come from my lips. We did initiate a climb to about 2500 ft.; the warning stopped. The Captain said that we were within about 800 ft. to the ground.In truth I really wasn't familiar with ZZZ; and at night. The conditions were VMC & beautiful which played its part in luring me away from a more thorough briefing of the chart (i.e. MSA; potential terrain & obstacles.) We were descending to the previously assigned altitude; when we were cleared for the visual approach. I prematurely set and continued descending to 1600 ft.Always thoroughly brief the charts even in VMC and especially at night. Maybe tell the controller something like; 'I'm really not that familiar with this area. Could we get vectors to join final outside (ZZZZZ)'; then you won't be spending as much attention 'looking over your shoulder' to keep the field in sight amongst all the city lights. I also feel I should spend more personal time studying and practicing actions and callouts for maneuvers outside of my annual Recurrent Training.",,"Conditions were nighttime VMC with a full moon and partly cloudy skies; the First Officer (FO) was the pilot flying (PF); and I was the pilot monitoring (PM). The FO briefed the approach approximately 80 miles prior to top of descent as a visual backed up by the ILS. He used the briefing guide and covered every step. We were at approximately 3000 ft. MSL being vectored on downwind to Runway XX. The Approach Controller advised us the airport was at 9 o'clock and 5 miles. I confirmed with the FO that he saw the field; we discussed the location of the rotating beacon and the ramp lighting; and the red airport lighting that was visible. I then advised Approach Control that we had the field in sight. We were cleared the visual approach to Runway XX and instructed to contact the Tower. I had to look at the Jeppesen app for the Tower frequency; then tuned the radio; and then advised Tower we were on a left downwind for a visual approach to Runway XX. The FO requested that I extend the FMS course off of ZZZZZ (FAF); which we confirmed and was executed. My attention was divided from inside the aircraft doing PM duties to outside the aircraft watching the runway because it was on my side of the aircraft. After extending off the FAF; I was looking out the left side of the aircraft and told the FO he should start his turn to base; and he started a turn. At some point; the FO had reached up and dialed the FAF altitude; 1600 ft.; into the Flight Management Panel (FMP) and pulled the knob for an open descent. I did not confirm the FMP altitude change and did not realize he had done it. I heard the radio altimeter auto callout of 'one-thousand' then the EGPWS triggered a 'caution terrain' verbal cue; and the FO didn't immediately respond verbally or physically. I told him he needed to level off or climb to stop the caution; and he needed to do that immediately. Approximately 2 seconds later we received a 'pull up' warning from the GPWS. The FO had disconnected the Autopilot; but still didn't respond aggressively enough so I pulled back on my stick to point the nose of the aircraft up and start a climb. The aircraft climbed above 2500 ft. and the caution/warning stopped. At that point the Flight Director had reverted to a basic mode of climb at 1600 ft. per minute because we were above the altitude in the FMP; however the FO leveled off at approximately 2500 ft. MSL and was not following Flight Director commands. Since there is no published missed approach procedure for a visual approach; I felt staying within the expected visual approach pattern and altitude was the safest course of action; and we were now stable at a safe pattern altitude on a base leg. We were about 6 miles from the runway; well into our base turn; but still offset from the runway about 30 degrees; with the FO heading the aircraft at the runway threshold rather than on an intercept angle. I asked him if he still saw the runway while pointing it out; and he responded 'yes.' I advised him he needed to turn right to intercept a normal final approach course above 1000 ft. AFL. The FO changed his heading to an appropriate base leg heading. Now that we were close in to the field; I reached up and selected 2000 ft. in the altitude window and advised him I was pulling the altitude knob for an open descent so the aircraft could stabilize at an appropriate altitude for the base leg. At some point the FO had reached up and turned the Autopilot back on; but he didn't verbalize it so I don't know exactly when. After the aircraft stabilized at 2000 ft. on base leg; I had to prompt him if he was ready for the gear and flaps; and he then followed SOPs to configure and call for the before landing checklist. The FO made an appropriate heading correction to intercept the final approach course and turned the Autopilot back off. He was currently on the correct 300 ft. per 1 mile glide path and the localizer had not captured yet. He was going to be high at the intercept point if he didn't descend; so I told him I was selecting a VVI of 700 down to keep him on G/S. He intercepted final approach course on glideslope; and at 1000 ft. AFL he was fully configured and stable; so I allowed him to continue. After landing we taxied to the gate and ran all the normal flows and checklists. After the shutdown checklist was complete; I stated 'Let's talk about the approach.' He asked; 'Was the GPWS warning caused by my descent rate?' I said 'No; it was because you were too close to the ground.' I advised him the GPWS 'warning' was because he ignored the 'caution terrain' and he was about 800 ft. above the ground at the lowest point; and that was scary that we could get in that position. I stated we should not have descended out of our last assigned altitude until on a 3-to-1 glide path. During our conversation; I realized he had little awareness of the terrain to the southeast of the field. I explained the terrain rose rapidly there; and we were 5 miles south of the airport in a descent to 1600 MSL; with terrain ranging from 1565 to 2103 ft. in that area; including some towers. I referenced the engine out procedure for Runway XY and explained we were flying through that same corridor. He didn't seem to understand the 300 ft. per mile guideline as a minimum altitude during an approach. He appeared to be under the impression that we could just fly a 1000 ft. box traffic pattern on an extended downwind and that would keep us clear of terrain. During his approach brief he stated 'there are no 10-7 page restrictions for our runway.' Before his brief I had reviewed the 10-7 special engine out procedure for Runway XY for general terrain awareness; but I didn't question his comment or expand upon it during the brief because I didn't know we would be vectored over it. I wish I had included that in my comments just in case. I openly admit that I had expectation bias that he was very experienced because of his seniority; and the fact that he appeared to be a 50+ year old pilot with 15+ year's experience flying. At the time of the GPWS event; I could see the ground and see the runway; and I evaluated the situation that after climbing to clear the conflict; we had time to stabilize and reconsider if it was safe to continue; so we continued without assistance from ATC. However; in hindsight; at the first 'caution; terrain' I should have said 'terrain; climb now; TOGA' to force him back into SOPs; if he didn't respond immediately then I should have said 'my aircraft' and kept it until he was back in the green section of the TEM (Threat and Error Management) model. FO violation of SOP for both pilots confirming altitude in FMP when the FO set a lower altitude but didn't ask me to confirm (and I was unaware). FO started descent when already below 3-to-1 glide path ratio. Lack of visual approach guidance in the Jeppesen Company pages when there is terrain in the area. Lack of standard Company 'escape' phraseology for executing the GPWS procedure. Changes to callouts in multiple other parts of SOP just adds confusion; and the FO stated that was one of his threats during his departure briefing.Unlike windshear; there is no concise standard callout the PM can use to tell the PF to perform the GPWS actions; and we need a standard trigger callout--'escape' would work fine and keep it simple. If the FO had followed FOM guidance to not descend below a 3-to-1 glide ratio; I don't think we would have got a GPWS warning; however there is not enough information published in the Jeppesen pages to make certain. The ZZZ charts are not to scale; so there is no precise way to know where the terrain is; and we were vectored below the MSA and navigating with visual reference to the ground at night. The category D circling minimums are 1180 ft. MSL for all runways; so the visual pattern needs to be tight to stay away from the terrain; but there isn't any information stating that. Company should add visual pattern guidance for all airports that have a10-7 engine out page for any runway; similar to the guidance for visual approaches at ZZZ1. An alternative to drawing a visual pattern diagram would be a 10-7 page comment that states 'Visual approach pattern must remain within X miles of the runway and above XXXX ft. MSL until established on a 3-to-1 final approach glidepath.' I believe night visual approaches should be prohibited at all fields with terrain/engine-out procedures until further guidance is published.",,"A319 flight crew reported receiving a GPWS alert while on approach.",

Five minutes later; Aircraft Z was at 4000 ft. 5 miles south-southwest of 5C1; on vectors to an approach. I noticed a 1200 code depart 5C1; southwest bound and climbing. I began issuing traffic to Aircraft Z when they were about 4 miles apart; traffic was at 2900 ft. Later issued traffic again; at 3300 ft. indicating now and 2 miles. And again; I call and tell Aircraft Z to climb and maintain 4500 ft.; traffic now out 3600 ft. and 1 mile. Aircraft Z calls 'got traffic in sight; he is right where we would have been; thank you approach' I have been here [many] years; I don't know how many reports I have done on 5C1. I know I stopped doing them years ago and watched events happen week after week. Numerous unsafe situations that are left unreported because we feel nothing will be done. It's clear to me now; in this agency; safety is not the number one priority. Dollars over Safety. How many reports do you need? How many CPC's do you need to tell you that 5C1 is unsafe? The talks with 5C1 pilots do not work; no more talking. I'm here again to remind you; 5C1 is getting busier every year. We NEED Class B or AT MINIMUM a Class C extension. Class B would be the most safe response as it would allow us to protect other key areas.

ATIS reported 10 km visibility with a scattered layer at 1;400 ft. and landing Runway 18R and Runway 18L. There was no mention of what type of approaches were in use. The initial Approach Controller told us to expect ILS 18R. When we were handed over to the final Approach Controller; we were told to fly direct to the LOS VOR. This is not normal but it seemed ATC was task saturated. I assumed this was for spacing. I thought we would be cleared for the ILS at some point prior to the VOR. ATC was keeping us high at FL50. We asked for lower. ATC told us to maintain FL50 and to report overhead LOS VOR. At this point we assumed we were going to be flown over the airport and then vectored downwind. When we reported over the VOR; we were told to report when we were outbound. It kind of looked like we had just been vectored for the full VOR ILS 18R approach without being told. I also concluded that this was happening because ATC traffic radar must have stopped working. We quickly established ourselves outbound on the VOR holding pattern and reported that we were outbound. ATC then told us to descent to 2;500 ft. Unfortunately; there was an airplane directly in front of us. The airplane was 500 ft. below us; crossing right to left and climbing into our approach path. We told ATC we were unable to accept the clearance do to traffic in front of us. ATC then aggressively told us again to descend to 2;500 ft. Right after that call; we got a TCAS traffic advisory on the airplane ahead of us. At no point did we receive an RA advisory. I deviated slightly right of course to ensure we would pass behind the conflicting airplane with adequate spacing. We waited until we were clear of the potential conflict and then started our descent to 2;500 ft. I can only assume ATC wasn't aware of the location of the traffic in front of us. This is most likely because the ATC radar was not working. ATC then told us to turn inbound and report inbound. After we reported inbound we were cleared for the ILS straight in approach. ATIS did not report what approaches were in use. ATIS did not report ATC radar as being out of service.ATIS did report VMC conditions. There were no NOTAMS for an inoperative radar at the LOS airport. We made several radio calls to ATC for clarification of what we were doing. As I mentioned earlier; they were completely task saturated and as a result we were unable to get a clear picture of what ATC's intentions were for us. So we were never cleared for the VOR ILS 18R approach. We were basically told to fly the procedure and when we turned around flying back towards the airport; we were then cleared for the ILS 18R approach. The ILS 18R approach is the approach we briefed. We can't say we were flying an approach we didn't brief because we were never cleared for the VOR ILS approach. We basically flew the procedure in VMC conditions. ATC was clearly using the full VOR ILS approach to sequence aircraft in a non radar environment without protecting the airspace on the holding side of the procedure turn.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported an ATC failure to separate aircraft resulted in a NMAC.

I focused on the cranes I had to clear over ZZZ and trimmed out some control pressure. I then noticed the alternator failed. I just flown the aircraft; trimmed it on the previous leg and checked the trims on the pre-flight checklist; therefore I believed there was some asymmetric thrust or drag. Between the Alternator failure and the seeming asymmetric thrust; I believed I may be slowly experiencing an engine problem; or might simply be having multiple systems (Flight Controls and Electrical) have abnormalities at once.

I initiated the turn to the left with rudder when I had sufficient space. The turn started but then the plane lurched left and stopped. After this I was unable to move the plane in any direction. At this time I thought I had a problem with the nose gear. I called the Tower and reported that I had a problem with my nose gear and that we could not move on the runway.

I shut down and secured the engines. I kept the Passengers on the plane as it was windy and cold outside and I didn't want them loose on the runway until transport arrived. When the bus arrived after about 10 minutes I opened the door and deplaned the Passengers. They boarded the bus. ZZZ operations personnel arrived with a tug and at this time we determined that the problem was with the left main gear and not the nose gear. The left main axle appeared to be broken and the tire was wedged against the strut. Operations brought a dolly to the plane for the left main gear.

We had reviewed the NOTAM's published in Jeppesen and there were no Notams about the taxiway.

Approach vectored us to the final approach course from the NE and cleared us for the RNAV X Rwy 17L inside TEBOY. Once established the altitude select was set to 7800 ft. for SEKAW. Aircraft descended and captured 7800 ft. Altitude select was then set for 6900 ft. for BADPE; PM confirmed. Crossing SEKAW; PF selected ALT mode on the autopilot to activate pitch mode. PF acknowledged '6900 ft. altitude armed'; PM confirmed. Shortly after the aircraft started to descend; ATC alerted 'Aircraft X; low altitude alert; check altitude immediately (Low altitude alert alarm heard in background)'. PF and PM confirmed aircraft was at 7100 ft. with altitude alert set to 6900 ft. for BADPE and the altimeter was set to 29.69'. PF noted aircraft was still about 1.5nm from BADPE. PM acknowledged ATC's alert. Moments later the aircraft's TAWS alerted 'Terrain; Terrain; Pull Up; Pull Up'. PF immediately disconnected the autopilot applied power and started climbing. TAWS alerting system immediately disengaged around 7300 ft. PM asked ATC if they could confirm the low altitude alert was no longer a factor. ATC confirmed. At this point the aircraft was beyond BADPE. PF Reengaged the autopilot and set the altitude select to the minimums of 5400 ft. Aircraft broke out of the clouds around 6600 ft. Taxiing into the ramp ATC asked for conditions on the approach. The Captain later recalled an approach they flew into this same airport a short time before. They were following a Citation on the same approach (RNAV X Rwy17L) ahead of them who received the same low altitude alert from ATC. The aircraft DID NOT receive the low altitude alert on this occasion; only the Citation ahead. This may be a common occurrence with the presence of turbulence and LLWS for this approach. Just a half mile from BADPE; terrain is charted at 6146 ft. providing only 754 ft. of clearance from the segmented minimum at 6900 ft. Even with our aircraft at 7100 ft. and 954 ft. of clearance both ATC and the aircraft's TAWS were alerted to low altitude and terrain respectively. That being said; I believe this approach should be looked at and the BADPE intersection revaluated to provide more clearance.

The RPMs were indicating ~2;300 RPM and as I pulled the throttle back; got no change in power output. I pulled throttle all the way to Idle and still got no change in RPMs. I enriched and leaned the mixture and got power changes to RPMs. Mag check was fine; all engine indications were what would be expected at cruise. I called ZZZ Approach on XXX.XX to tell them of the problem we were having and told them we would be diverting to ZZZ. I descended to ~ 6;400 ft. MSL and over flew the field to check wind direction. Once it was determined the winds were out of the east; we flew west bound to set up for a straight in for Runway X. I decided to fly straight in and as we got closer to the runway began leaning the mixture knob to the point of getting an RPM drop in order to slow down enough to add flaps for landing. Once we were assured of making it to the runway we shut down the engine and glided in for landing. No issues on the landing and had enough momentum to clear the runway. [An airport tenant] came out to the airplane and helped us push it to his hangar. The Mechanic I was with borrowed tools from the Good Samaritan and removed the cowling to check for the problem.

As best I can remember we were around 3000 feet and on a right base to Runway XX. We were advised to check altitude. The pilot flying climbed as a response to around 3600 feet. The surrounding terrain was hilly and I believe the reason for the alert was we could see a tower nearby off our right wing (not a factor) that likely was what resulted in the alert. A factor in this was the pilot flying sitting in the left seat and couldn't see the runway the whole approach. He thought he was higher than he was. I could have helped him more with reports about his altitude and distance since I could see the airport out my window. There was no reason for us to be that low that far out.

I sumped the 13 fuel sump locations after checking the level with a fuel stick as per the checklist. Upon collecting the fuel sample from the last left-wing fuel sump; the o-ring would not reseal correctly. After pushing the needle into the sump gently; collecting the sample; and pulling the needle out; as I have always done; straight up and straight down with no excessive force; fuel began to leak out of the sump nozzle in a continuous stream. I finessed the needle of the sump cup in and out to seal the sump as best as I could but it was still leaking.At this point; which was after closing time for the FBO with no maintenance staff; I video-called my Commercial Pilot's License Instructor on my phone's [video calling] to ask for help with reseating the o-ring and to show him video evidence of the situation. He instructed me to continue to attempt to reseat the o-ring with the fuel sump cup needle. After retrying to seal it; the leak had begun to stream from the sump again as opposed to the drip I managed to reduce it to. He immediately hung up with me to call the owner of the flight school to which the plane belonged. My instructor called me back and told me that the owner wanted me to fly back to the home airport; as-is. My instructor was adamant that this was my decision and stressed that it was up to me if I felt comfortable with the situation as pilot in command. A first-hand witness of the owner's side of the conversation; who was in the room with the owner when he was on the phone with my instructor; back at the school; confirmed to me that the owner was resolute and uncompromising on the matter; fully intent on me to fly the aircraft back with the leak. Whether it was a demand or not; I'm not entirely sure. Again; my instructor relayed this to me but was clear that if I felt uncomfortable or unable; that was my choice. My instructor is a considerate man with strong moral integrity; a combat US Army veteran with the utmost respect for safety and regulation. I want to be very clear on that point. While still on [the video call] with my instructor I managed to seal the sump enough to contain the leak so a very slow drip. By now; the leak was reduced to about a single drop every few seconds. I told him I would let him know of my decision.This is where my ASRS report becomes important. I exercised poor ADM and decided to fly the plane back home. I rechecked the level of fuel in both tanks and confirmed with the fuel stick to still have 26.5 gallons in each tank. When I left the home airport there were 50 gallons onboard; and when I refueled; 13 gallons were administered. Meaning that; with a headwind; the flight; including taxi; run-up; takeoff; and climb-out consumed 10 gallons with a 50-degree rich of peak EGT mixture with an actual time enroute of 1.2 hours. Knowing my destination was 110 NM away; with a calculated KTAS of 110 kt. and a strong tailwind; I would be at my destination in; conservatively; one hour. With an overly conservative fuel burn rate of 12 gallons per hour; 3 gallons for taxi; run-up; takeoff; and climb-out; which is double what the POH specifies; and considering an extremely conservative estimate of leaking 5 gallons per hour; I would make it back home well within legal VFR fuel minimum requirements. The leak rate was nowhere near this high. I knew that I could make it back with the fuel entirely in the right tank alone; if necessary. Especially if I ran the mixture at peak EGT. I would be flying a straight-in approach to a runway aligned with my route of flight and my route took me directly over an alternate airport; with a runway aligned with surface winds and pilot-controlled lighting; as well as along paved; lighted; wide stretches of highway; in a plane that was equipped with G1000 avionics containing calibrated fuel level sensors and a fuel flow rate gauge. Then after considering the amount of leaking fuel; the location of the leak; i.e.; on the aft underside of the wing with no electrical or mechanical equipment behind it; and what kind of fire hazards it might present if any; I determined the minuscule leak was of an inconsequential nature to the safety of flight. I contacted my instructor via text to inform him of my decision and began following the checklists for departure. I climbed out and requested VFR flight following with Center frequency. Upon being instructed to contact Approach for my destination; I informed the Approach Controller of a small fuel leak and requested to expedite the approach for a straight-in landing on my desired runway. After doing so; ATC asked me if I knew where the leak was coming from and I informed them that it was insight and coming from the left wing sump nozzle. At this point; they gave me priority handling; said that they were rolling the fire trucks out to the runway; and asked for remaining fuel and souls onboard. I landed the plane without incident and was escorted back to the flight school's Ramp by a fire truck. The owner was outside the hangar waiting for me with a tow bar and bucket to catch any leaking fuel. I checked the level in each tank after shutting down and found 17 gallons in the right-wing tank and 15 gallons in the left-wing tank with the leak. This was a life lesson I won't soon forget. Aside from never doing something like that again; it has taught me that I can truly only rely on myself for taking my complete safety into serious consideration because the school owner didn't seem to mind much knowing there was a leak and insisting I fly home like that. After telling my wife what had happened; she was beside herself with my lack of judgment in putting our mutual future together in jeopardy. It prompted me to retake a hazardous attitudes inventory test and; after finding out later that that very plane has had the same exact fuel sump nozzle leak profusely; to start looking for a new school to finish my CPL and to later instruct for. Neither I nor my instructor knew that this plane had experienced that issue in the recent past. I was not informed of it before renting it.",,,,"C172S pilot reported a fuel sump drain could not be reseated while performing the preflight check.

On the Pacific Track Alpha; R463. Shortly after passing the critical point; CP; after ZZZZZ; at FL360; we approached the northern edge of a SIGMET area of forecasted moderate CAT turbulence from FL300 - FL360. Radar was on; showing scattered green return after adjusting tilt for best display. Verbal PIREPs from other aircraft indicated light chop to occasional moderate chop was the overall consensus. None were getting a smooth ride; but the higher altitudes reported better. Weather chart showed no turbulence on forecast above FL360 though the information was several hours old from before departure. Previously asked by ATC; via CPDLC; 'When can we accept FL370?' and we said; 'At this time;' but did not receive clearance. We were mostly above the cloud layer; but occasionally in and out of the tops. Seat belt sign was on. Got a moderate jolt and said; 'Flight attendants; take your jump seats;' on the PA. Requested FL370 due to weather. Received clearance via CPDLC and climbed to FL370. Ride slightly better and now above the cloud layer. Continuous light chop ensued; with a couple moderate bumps; for the next 20 minutes. During a period of only intermittent light chop; I called back on the service interphone to check on the flight attendants. I told them possible weather still ahead; based on a green radar return; and even though it was relatively smooth; I wanted them to remain in their jump-seat until we passed the weather; approximately 20 minutes. Roughly 5 minutes later; just after we passed over the ZZZZZ1 fix; airspeed and altitude began to fluctuate. This was quickly followed by a pitch up; autopilot disconnect; high speed clacker and stick shaker; and moderate or worse jolts of turbulence and Saint Elmo's fire on the forward windscreens. The copilot called 'upset' and hand-flew the airplane. He worked to keep the airspeed between high and low speed limits while allowing the altitude to vary and keep G-loading to a minimum; as I called out altitude and climbing/descending. Altitude variation of +/- 1;000 ft.; airspeed variation of +/-30 kt. Bank angles of 15 degrees. Incident lasted approximately 2 minutes. Reengaged automation. Checked on flight attendants and passengers. One Flight Attendant in the aft galley had been thrown to the ceiling and then back on the floor; as well as side to side. She did not have her seat belt on at the time. All other flight attendants and passengers were buckled in and OK.Reported severe turbulence to other aircraft over VHF.

Started phone patch with Dispatch on HF to give PIREP; initiate a maintenance report with Maintenance; and gave injury assessment of the Flight Attendant. Later on; after a failed SATCOM call attempt; made another phone patch to include MEDLINK; to determine medical capabilities at destination; and give updates on Flight Attendant condition - after time had passed to assess her condition further. Copilot flew the aircraft and handled ATC communications as we flew into radar reception range. Flight Attendant said she had no broken bones or sprains; just soreness and possible bruising. She felt 'tossed around and wringed out' but fully functional and capable to continue to destination; as well as fly the return leg back to ZZZ. We were given the okay to continue to ZZZ1 from MEDLINK; and they arranged for paramedics to meet the aircraft at destination. Copilot flew RNP approach to landing in ZZZ1 on Runway XX.

Runway XXR (long runway) was closed; so we had to do a bleeds off; anti-ice on; max thrust take-off from XXL. A 737 departed approximately 3 minutes prior to our departure and reported a 15 knot loss shear with mod turbulence approximately 2;000 feet AGL over tower frequency. When we heard the report; we were already on the runway with clearance to take off. There had been no discussion of the reported threat of loss shear on departure in mountainous terrain at night; so I asked the Captain if he was OK with taking off in that report and he responded 'Yup' as he advanced power and started the takeoff roll. No further discussion occurred. During climb out; we immediately encountered moderate turbulence on lift off all the way through approximately 12-13;000 feet MSL. Somewhere around 2;000-3;000 feet AGL (approximately 6-7;000 feet MSL) we experienced multiple windshear events; with the most significant being a 20+ knot loss shear. The green airspeed trend arrow shot way down; maybe even to the bottom of the speed tape; and we experienced approximately 1 second of stick shaker. The airspeed maybe dropped into roughly 165 KIAS (hard to see with that much turbulence and the airspeed bouncing all over) but never dropped into the amber shaker band. Soon after; and roughly around 7-8;000 feet MSL; we encountered 1-2 hits of severe turbulence. After climbing through roughly 12;000 feet MSL; the turbulence calmed down and we continued on to ZZZ1. Once we were safely out of the events; I made a PIREP back to ZZZ tower to inform them of the 20+ knot loss shear and severe turbulence; and the Captain informed dispatch via ACARS message. At no point during the take off roll or climb out did we receive a wind shear indication or warning from the aircraft.",,"Prior to our departure from ZZZ I briefed the flight attendants and instructed them to remain seated until we let them know it was safe.

Another jet that departed before use reported moderate turbulence from the surface to 12;000 feet and a loss of 15 to 20 knots. Upon climb out we experienced moderate turbulence immediately after takeoff. At some point during the turbulence event I'm guessing 6 to 7;000 feet MSL we had a 1 second stick shaker. We continued the climb and at approximately 12;000 feet MSL we were out of the moderate turbulence. I then reported the turbulence to dispatch.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a wind shear encounter soon after takeoff resulting in a  low airspeed stick shaker.

We respected the required cool down time before I called for the shut down of the #2 engine for a single engine taxi to the gate.As soon as the First Officer (FO) placed the master switch to off we heard the normal click of the generator then experienced a sudden violent and continued yaw to the right. I used left tiller and left brake to to stay on the taxi way and the airplane came to an abrupt stop. Ground controllers called and ask if we were OK and if we needed assistance. They later told me they observed the airplane yaw hard and smoke billow from under the airplane. (Assuming from sliding tires)After we stopped I released all manual brake pressure in an urge to return to center-line and the airplane did not move. I set the parking brake. Resetting the A/SKID / N/W STRG switch and then releasing the parking brake and the aircraft began to roll with noticeable thumping of flat spots during taxi in.Maintenance was called and jacked up the right side and spun the tires; finding both mains with relatively new tires significantly flat spotted.  #3 brake was found dragging and maintenance mentioned deferring it for 5 landings. I communicated that it's a solution that doesn't address the fact that #4 tire was also flat spotted. After several more hours Maintenance deactivated the #3 brake completely and proffered a ferry flight to ZZZ1. A solution that again doesn't address why the #4 tire was flat spotted.After 5+ hours on the ground and at XA:00 I received an unsolicited call from the flight manager. The flight manager mentioned his [decades long career] and how hard it would be for the company to address fixing the airplane in ZZZ.My safety concerns can be divided into three main areas of concern:If this airplane goes back in service without a concrete reason or problem that can be mitigated. What if a generator trips for an unrelated reason? What should be a flicker of screens at V1 could instead be a violent uncontrolled total lockup of two main tires. Previously we carefully controlled the moment of power transfer; is this un-commanded and uncontrolled application of brakes a specific failure mode of a component? Should we be trained to expect this as a possibility on power transfers?  This certainly will factor into my decision whether or not to  single engine taxi.  If the problem happened on taxi out with the flight attendants up doing a demonstration my in-flight team could have been gravely hurt.Maintenance repeatedly ignoring the inconvenient fact that both #3 AND #4 were involved as indicated by the continual work on #3 while ignoring the evidence of #4s involvement. The nature of a complete and total lockup of both main tires and inability of the airplane to roll forward until the A/S NWS (Nose Wheel Steering) reset indicated that the physical components of the wheel Assembly/brakes worked fine. A reset of that switch clearly points to a brake valve or other electronic component that would be reset or changed by the movement of that switch.  Fishing for a ferry-able solution in the face of un-ferry-able reality is a setup for tragedy. As the timeline between indoc. and upgrading to narrow body Captain becomes shorter; are we expecting relatively new and inexperienced Captains to be a backstop against a poor decision to ferry without a real diagnosis?My most pressing concern is reserved for the usage of the flight manager as a lever to push an unsafe solution. He specifically mentioned that ZZZ was a challenging place to work on an airplane and it would be advantageous to have the airplane at a maintenance base.In it's most mild interpretation it could be considered an incredibly stupid thing to say from someone with manager in the title to a safety sensitive employee evaluating a safety decision. The economic inconvenience of where an airplane is should have no weight on the evaluation of it's safety to operate.  A Captain should know better. In a more malicious interpretation and what I believe is closer to the truth: this is a clear case of 'pilot pushing.' The fact that maintenance skipped right over calling me and instead had the flight manager call made the intention crystal clear. When I call a flight manager I get help. When they call me it's to push. Continued tolerance for this behavior from someone not legally responsible for a flight will have future unintended consequences.  As our indoctrination; mentoring and education period before upgrade shortens; a flight manager applying pressure might get what they wish for: The ability to influence a safety decision....not with new and pertinent operational information but with inappropriate consideration of a number on a balance sheet with possible tragic results.",,"During taxiing in and cool-down requirements are met.

We were aware of the 5G NOTAM driving an RNAV approach as opposed to the ILS and briefed our contingency plans of a divert to ZZZ1; weather required for the approaches; and we involved our dispatcher well prior to TOD. We began the approach but updated weather indicated the airport was below minimums; so we coordinated to hold. While in holding; Company advised that another flight landed successfully; and with updated weather we had the visibility required to begin the approach. ATC amended our holding altitude from 5;000 feet to 7;000 feet but we forgot to put our new cruise altitude in the FMC like we did before attempting the first approach. We received vectors to intercept the final approach course and commenced the approach but didn't recognize our lack of vertical guidance due to not entering a new cruise altitude. The aircraft appeared to be flying the approach in LNAV/VNAV passing the final approach point; but began a descent rate approaching 1;500 fpm that wasn't recognized. The Relief Pilot and Pilot Flying (PF) began looking for approach lights as we approached minimums and said they had the approach lights in sight and so we continued the approach; still descending faster than planned. All of us were looking for the runway environment. At about the same time the PF and Relief Pilot saw 4 reds on the PAPI we received an EGPWS terrain warning. I incorrectly called for a Go Around instead of CFIT Recovery; and during the maneuver the pitch attitude became excessive and we received a low airspeed caution as it decreased to around 105 knots. We completed the maneuver; sorted through the distraction of low fuel cautions due to our 10;000 lbs. of fuel sloshing during the go around; and diverted to ZZZ1.In hindsight; the error chain began when we were given holding instructions that included a climb from 5;000 feet to the holding altitude of 7;000 feet. The PF selected FLCH for the climb but neither the PF nor I updated the cruise page; possibly because a climb into holding in the terminal area is not a normal occurrence. We had ample time to update the FMC but both crew and Relief Pilot were trying to build SA on if the weather was improving; if another airplane successfully landed; how much fuel we had to hold; etc. Had I taken the time to update the FMC altitude after building the hold; we would have had vertical guidance. Once we left the hold I should have looked for the VNAV path indicator in addition to energy state and configuration. Once we passed the Final Approach Point I focused more on our height above minimums and scanning the runway environment instead of backing up the PF with flight path monitoring. The end result was flight path management degraded to the point of an EGPWS warning.",,"Following holding; Crew flew RNAV into ZZZ. The crew made common errors on the approach and ultimately descended inappropriately below the MDA using faulty visual cues. Immediately following the Captain stating they had visual cues and was proceeding visually; I noticed four RED PAPI lights and alerted the crew. The subsequent Go-Around resulted in a 'Caution Terrain' and then 'Whoop-Whoop; PULL-UP' I suspect the descent had inadvertently been continued during the go-around; which caused the GPWS Caution/Warning. Then; the Crew misapplied established procedures on the subsequent go around; which resulted in excessively slow airspeed. I had to Intervene during both the RNAV approach and subsequent Go-Around to ensure safety.Crew should have realized there was not a proper vertical path and either modified descent rate or discontinued the approach.  Also; crew should have had the Situational Awareness to know that they were still several miles from approximate VDP; and use that information when deciding to proceed below the MDA. During the Go-Around; the First Officer (FO) became task saturated with non-critical items (FMS; ATC Communication; etc;) and failed to monitor Flight Path adequately and perform Pilot Monitoring (PM) duties correctly.  This greatly affected the Safety of Flight during the Go-Around.",,"B767 flight crew reported an unstable approach coupled with an EGWPS terrain warning and non-adherence to SOP's contributed to the crew descending below minimums on an RNAV approach in poor weather.",

During this time we continuously monitored the Cabin Rate and Cabin Pressure. Between switching the Cabin Pressure between manual and automatic we were able to briefly stabilize the pressure from increasing too rapidly. As we continued our climb the pressure became more uncontrollable through the use of the manual mode and it eventually began to rise rapidly towards a Cabin Altitude High CAS message. During all of the events above; Person A and I were using great communication and decision-making on what to do if we started to get closer to that Cabin Altitude High CAS message. Communication with ATC about a descent request was established well before the CAS message displayed. Simultaneously we began our descent and the CAS message went off.Both pilots noted and continuously monitored the situation. Good communication between the two of us on what to do and when to do it. Cabin Altitude High CAS message displayed. The cause of this event was due to a Lavatory Cap that had become dislodged from its original position; causing a pressure leak from the valve located in the toilet. While in talks with ATC we were given a 'standby; traffic' on our original descent request before the Cabin Altitude High CAS message displayed.

The Captain was 'pilot flying'. I was 'pilot monitoring'. During the flight we had a Flight Attendant on board as well as passengers in the back. Some time after departing ZZZ1; ATC asked us to climb and maintain FL220. Continuing our climb towards flight level 220; we received a 'Cabin ALT' caution message on the EICAS display of the airplane. This yellow caution message chimed and illuminated around our passing near FL210. In response; the Captain called for the QRH. I grabbed the QRH and read through perhaps the first two items when I saw the Captain don his oxygen mask. Peering up; I saw that he was responding to a new alert on the EICAS. The new alert was a red warning message stating; "Cabin ALT." I now realized what had happened while I was reading the QRH. In response; I too donned my oxygen mask; confirmed the mask was delivering 100%; and established communications with the Captain. This completed the Company 'memory items' found on the Immediate Action Checklist; IAC. With both of us having completed that step; I grabbed the IAC and read aloud the title and the steps. The Captain performed the actions in the IAC and began a descent from FL220 to 9;000 ft. The Captain told me to tell ATC that we were descending to 9;000 ft. I called ATC and told them that we were descending from FL220 to 9;000 ft. in response to a situation and that I would get back to them shortly.I then grabbed the QRH again and turned to the page titled; 'Cabin ALT (Warning Message) -or- Emergency Descent Procedure.' As per the QRH; I read through the IAC again and we confirmed we actuated all items in the IAC. During this time ATC asked us if we were [requesting priority handling]. The Captain responded to ATC that we were [requesting priority handling] and descending to 10;000 ft. ATC came back and authorized a descent to 11;000 ft. I responded to ATC with the 'descend and maintain' request. I continued with the QRH while the Captain responded to my prompts. During this time ATC asked if we would like to divert to ZZZ. The Captain indicated to me that we would accept a diversion to ZZZ. ATC then cleared us down to 9;000 ft. We descended and maintained that ALT. At separate times during our descent and level-off at 9;000 ft. the Flight Attendant called the cockpit. After trouble hearing one another; we eventually heard each other well and the Flight Attendant was able to confirm there was no damage to the plane. She and the passengers were fine. One person towards the back was 'nervous' but she said she was able to calm the passenger. I told her that we have passed through 10;000 ft. and that we will be diverting to ZZZ. Following the QRH; we determined that control of the cabin pressurization had been regained and continued to the manual pressurization control procedure. ATC cleared us from 9;000 ft. to 5;000 ft.By this time we had completed all steps of the QRH except for the final step; a decision tree asking if the 'differential pressure' is zero upon landing. I reiterated to the Captain that; as I read the QRH; it seems like it can only truly be 'complete' on the ground because the assessment of differential pressure and the decision tree is determined "upon landing." We went back and forth about this but concluded that we were ready to be vectored further towards ZZZ. By this point; the Captain requested the Company procedure be conducted. We confirmed we established communications with ATC and sent Dispatch a message. We called the Flight Attendant again and reviewed the game plan and got an update from her. Shortly thereafter; the Captain made a passenger announcement. The airplane was secured for approach and landing and the Captain informed the passengers there will be no need for bracing. Dispatch quickly came back with an amendment to our Flight Release. It read Amendment 1 with a new destination of ZZZ. It included other pertinent information; including the Dispatcher's time stamp.We confirmed the weather at ZZZ and requested vectors for the RNAV XX approach. ATC gave us delayed vectors and a descent down to 4;000 ft. We complied with Company checklists and prepared for the approach. As we got closer to the airport ATC asked if we needed emergency crews to meet us on the ground. The Captain said no. We conducted the approach and landed at ZZZ on Runway XX. We were followed down the taxiway by Airport Rescue & Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles. On the ground; we officially completed the QRH by completing the last step confirming the differential pressure was zero upon landing. With that; the QRH read; 'No further action required.' End of QRH... We taxied to Gate XX I believe? Eventually the passengers were allowed off the plane and the Captain was greeted by a Fireman.

Our flight was about 2 hours delayed on the gate due to a ground stop issued by ZZZ Center. There were many disruptions preparing to push for this flight and ATC gave us no timeline on when we would be able to push to depart for ZZZ. We were about 20 minutes from our duty time limit and finally received clearance to push. Upon taxi out; NAS Ground told us we were number 9 for takeoff. We were initially given instructions to taxi to [Runway] 28 via Hotel taxiway and hold short of [Taxiway] H5 for arriving traffic into H5. As the traffic turned into the FBO and we were given instructions to continue taxiing; we started the number 2 engine and ran our before-takeoff flow/checklist. During this time I was heads down doing my part of the flow and running the checklist and both me and the CA (Captain) realized a line of aircraft waiting to take off; which we both assumed we were behind since Ground told us we were number 9 to depart. We were both concerned with our duty time limit and tried to determine if we would be able to make our time; but we also had an expectation that we were behind the aircraft waiting to take off. As I lifted my head I realized we were approaching the hold-short of 28 and told the CA to stop - but before I could hit the brakes myself or the CA could stop; we rolled past the new hold-short line of Runway 28. In this particular situation all arrivals were on Runway 32 and Ground told us all departures were off 28. So what we thought was the line of aircraft waiting for 28 ended up being aircraft waiting to depart [Runway] 32; which ultimately made us lose SA where Runway 28 was after all.Cause - expectation we were in line with other aircraft for departures off 28; concern of not making duty time limit; and the pressure of cancelling flight. We both had an early morning van that morning and had been stuck in the aircraft waiting for over 2 hours to push. I also personally feel that doing the before-takeoff flow creates a heads-down situation for the FO and at airports that are unfamiliar; there is really no safe time to do it during taxi and should be done before the aircraft moves under power.I feel the single-engine taxi and flight control check had me heads-down on a straightaway taxi clearly was a threat that wasn't caught during the briefing. This particular airport diagram looks very straightforward on paper; but the intersection on the straight taxi to 32 where 28 intersects should definitely be a hotspot that other crew members should be aware of. Taxiway Hotel goes across the approach end of Runway 28 and when your attention is diverted to the line of aircraft awaiting to takeoff Runway 32; it is very easy to miss that Runway 28 is even there until you're right on it. There is also a new hold-short line for Runway 28 and an older hold-short line that is blacked out that is ironically bolder and more pronounced than the new one. Regardless of whether you are going to 32 or 28; this intersection should be briefed as a threat and furthermore a hotspot circle added to the airport diagram.",,"Flight delayed 1 hour 40 minutes at gate MYNN due to ZZZ Center ground stop. The flight crew had an early report and 3 legs. This was the last leg and we were getting close to duty time limit. We discussed this at gate for most of the delay. We were concerned about pushing and taxiing to hold to wait for release. This would certainly exceed the duty time limit. We received push clearance for Runway 28 departure. I asked Ground Control what number we would be for departure. He stated number 9. At this point we only had 25 minutes remaining to duty time limit. We received clearance to taxi to Runway 28 via [Taxiway] H.I went on Taxiway H. I could see aircraft holding at the far end of the taxiway. I thought those aircraft were holding short of Runway 28 because I was thinking we would be about number 7 for takeoff by now and that's where the lineup was. Ground Control switched us to Tower frequency. As I was taxiing I saw a small sign that said [Runway] 28; so I slowed. Tower called and said; "Aircraft X you're departing 28." I then saw the 28 hold-short and stopped suddenly; but was a few feet past the Runway 28 hold-short line. The aircraft ahead of me were further down H; holding short of [Runway] 32. I was number 1 for 28. No aircraft landing on 28. Aircraft were landing on 32. After a couple arrivals on 32; we were cleared for takeoff on 28. No mention of my error by ATC.I was distracted by the possibility of exceeding the duty time limit. I was thinking about what the plan would be if we did. I may have been task saturated. We spent a lot of time coordinating and communicating with Gate Agent; Dispatch; [and] Ground Control. A big part of the error was caused by me thinking I was going to be in line for departure and that's where I was heading. In line; but at Runway 32. I wasn't rushing. I had my chart out. I think fatigue was also a factor. I had an early morning van [and] I had been on a cycle of a much later wake-up. Even though I didn't rush I think I needed to slow down.

There were storms forecasted during the time of arrival into ZZZ. I made a mental note of the weather prior to takeoff and noted the winds favoring Runways XX and XY and started to plan for that unless the weather had a change by the time I arrived. Runway XX is the only runway from those two options that has an instrument approach available. They were broadcasting the VOR XX with winds 120 at 12. I requested the RNAV GPS XX instead due to my equipment on board that could fly that approach. While on the descent to ZZZ I noticed on my radar there was a cell over the airport where I would be approaching from. I asked ZZZ Approach if they were showing the same thing. Initially; he said no. While being vectored for the approach ZZZ [TRACON] told me they actually do see a moderate cell that was over the final approach fix ZZZZZ. I made note of this because this could affect my approach and cause unstable wind conditions and being aware of windshear and/or a wind shift. I calculated my REF and VAPP to be 108/115 based off my weight at the time. The runway was very wet and I calculated my wet landing distance to be within tolerances for Runway XX. We experienced light to moderate turbulence during the approach. The rain was coming down extremely hard at the time as well. I was able to to stay at around VAPP (115) during the descent. I could then visually see the runway at 700 ft. so I pulled the power back to VREF (108). I remained at VREF over the threshold and then pulled power to idle. I started to slightly float and it felt like a wind shift had occurred and had a tailwind. I put the airplane down and deployed the ground flaps and speed brakes on touchdown. I then applied brake pressure and they initially started to slow the aircraft and then more than halfway I lost all braking action and could not get the aircraft stopped. The anti skids did not feel like they were working. It was at the point where I could not commit to a go around and maneuvered the aircraft into an area of the end of the runway where I thought no one would be injured and the aircraft would not sustain severe damage. This was at the approach end of Runway XZ. No one was hurt and the airplane did not have any damage. Going forward I will take the steps necessary to make sure this does not happen again.",,,,"C525 Pilot reported a runway excursion on wet runway during the landing rollout.",

I told her we had about an hour to go; there was no need to prep for an evacuation; I had no special instructions; and I would update her if things changed.We reviewed the Engine Shutdown Checklist; kept the fuel balanced; checked the single-engine performance page of the FMC; and continued to monitor the engine. The Bypass Light reilluminated about every 3 - 5 minutes during flight and go out when the throttle was slightly reduced. Each time the N1 needed for the light to go out was a little lower. I sent a maintenance write-up and info report; logging the multiple N1 numbers when the Bypass Light came on; and what setting it went off. Per the Oil Bypass Light Checklist and our conversations with Dispatch / Maintenance; we continued towards ZZZ2. It appeared more likely that we would end up shutting down the engine; so I called the flight attendants and gave an updated briefing. I told her we were about 10 - 15 minutes of committed to continuing to ZZZ2; and to consider no news is good news on the need to divert. Fortunately; ATC needed a slower than normal speed from us; as we would not have been able to hold a fast; 0.78 mach or 300+ kt. if they needed it.We requested to descend early so the Number 1 Engine could operate at a further reduced setting. Just after the start of descent; the Oil Bypass Light came on again; and did not extinguish with the throttle at idle. The Oil Bypass checklist directed us to the Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist. We followed the checklist; shut down the engine; advised Dispatch we were shutting down the engine; and about to [request priority handling]. After shutting down the Number 1 Engine; [requested priority handling] with ATC.After completing the checklist to the descent briefing portion; I did another briefing with the flight attendants and made a PA to the passengers. I did not have the flight attendants prepare the cabin for an evacuation - as we would be landing on a dry; long runway it did not seem necessary. In my view; "Prepare the Cabin" meant briefing the passengers on brace positions; and additional briefings with the passengers in the exit rows. Discussions with Person B after landing determined that she thought "Prepare for Evacuation" simply meant being more spring-loaded to evacuate herself; but no extra briefings of the passengers. There was obviously a big gap between what they think and what we think "Prepare for Evacuation" means in an immediate situation and this should be looked at and further addressed. I calmly told the passengers to expect a little faster than normal landing; they would see fire trucks follow us; and despite all this; we would still have them into ZZZ2 early; and I will see them at the gate. We had the checklist completed well before joining the approach to [Runway] XXL. We landed and fire / rescue confirmed there was no smoke / no evidence of abnormalities / no hot brakes before we taxied into the gate.",,"Normal ground operations and checks; with uneventful takeoff and initial departure out of ZZZ. Around XA:38; while climbing through approximately 23;000 ft. MSL for FL290 the Captain's side; Number 1 Engine Oil Bypass Light illuminated. Oil pressure was normal; RPM was normal; Number 1 Engine Oil Temperature was noted as slightly warmer - approximately N1 - 95 degrees; N2 - 77 degrees. Captain directed execution of 737 FM Non-Normal procedures. Checklist was accomplished in order; condition and light was confirmed. Autothrottle was disengaged; LNAV and VNAV remained engaged. Thrust lever was confirmed; then retarded slowly until approximately 77% N1 when the light extinguished. Light had extinguished so we proceeded. The Captain then contacted Dispatch and Maintenance after we discussed factors and positive control of the aircraft was passed to me. Dispatch and Maintenance recommendation was to continue; Captain and I used CRM / TEM (Threat and Error Management) and discussed possible threats to continuing the flight; and made the decision we concurred the flight could continue. After the Captain completed discussion with Dispatch / Maintenance he conducted a briefing with the FA (Flight Attendant) then took back control of the aircraft. Shortly after the Oil Filter Bypass Light illuminated again at approximately 77% N1; thrust was reduced to 75% N1; and the light extinguished. The decision was made to continue the flight in accordance with the current game plan while while we discussed CRM / TEM for possible engine failure and divert options. Decision point was made that prior to beginning descent into ZZZ2; an engine failure would be addressed by diverting to either ZZZ3 or ZZZ4. Once on the arrival at current altitude we would continue to ZZZ2. As we continued; the light illuminated again and another N1 reduction of approximately 2% was accomplished with the light extinguishing once again. The frequency of this trend then began to increase initial reduction to reillumination of the light was about 5 minutes between and by the time we began descent for the arrival we had decreased from 71% N1 to 68% and the light only remained off for approximately 1 - 2 minutes. By 27;000 ft. in the descent the light would illuminate again after only 30 seconds from each thrust reduction and Engine 1 Oil Temperature was noted as rising from 99 to 107 degrees Celsius as thrust was reduced all the way to idle closed. Once closed; step three of the Engine Oil Filter Bypass was conducted; following Oil Filter Bypass Light stays illuminated and Engine Failure or Shutdown Checklist for the NG; 737 FM was then executed per the publication. At this time the Captain [requested priority handling] with ZZZ2 Center. ZZZ2 Center kept us initially on the arrival but lifted all speed restrictions and gave a hard altitude of 14;000 ft. MSL for our descent. The Captain passed controls one more time with good confirmation to allow him to update the FAs; Dispatch / Maintenance; and review the arrival brief while covering CRM / TEM threats and mitigation. Once complete; controls were passed back to the Captain. I completed the remainder of the Engine Failure or Shutdown Non-Normal procedure; then proceeded to the Once Engine Inoperative Landing Non-Normal Checklist 737 FM. At this point ZZZ2 Approach had passed us to a single channel Approach frequency with a dedicated control and cleared us for the Visual XXL per our request as as that was our expected arrival and was loaded in the system. The checklist was completed in its entirety and the approach to landing was without incident and in accordance with all procedures and very much so reflected exactly the situations and training that we receive at the training center in the simulators. Airport & Rescue Firefighting (ARFF) was able to inspect the brakes and do a general safety check once we cleared the runway and an uneventful taxi to the gate was accomplished followed by shutdown. Training; support from ATC; Approach; Tower; Dispatch; Maintenance; and ARFF was all expertly and professionally handled with no issues detracting from the safe accomplishment of the flight. Training and checklist usage and the 737 FM were excellent tools for the situation with one suggestion in regards to the FM Checklist and Fuel Balance. By short final or landing rollout my best recollection was our fuel was at an imbalance of approximately 600 lb. with about 4;200 lb. on the Engine 1 side and 3;600 lb. on the Number 2 side. Although in tolerance and not unsafe this was a larger split than intended and the Captain and I had discussed a game plan for management and monitoring. The checklist however only mentions it one time during Step 9 of FM well prior to final landing; where much time might be spent with a growing imbalance of fuel. I recommend "Balance Fuel as Needed" be added to the end of the engine failure again; prior to Step 15 on FM; and then again add "Balance Fuel as Needed" prior to deferred items on FM during the Engine Inoperative Landing Non-Normal Checklist.",,"B737 Flight Crew reported the Number 1 Engine Oil Bypass Light illuminated during the climb out. After conferring with Dispatch and Maintenance; the decision was first made that the engine did not need to be shut down. However; as the flight continued to the destination and the Oil Bypass Light would not extinguish; the engine was then shut down.",

Threat forward briefing was used and we discussed short; wet runway; slight gusts for Runway 09. I elected a Flaps 40 landing configuration after balancing gusts vs. short / wet runway performance. No thunderstorms were reported at the field. After breaking out on short final at approximately 500 - 600 ft. AGL; ORD Tower called microburst; 2 miles west of Runway 09; our position. I called for and executed a go-around; we received no PWS (Predictive Wind Shear) indications. ATC asked why we were going around and the FO (First Officer) explained due to the microburst warning and Tower commanded we fly runway heading.The go-around mechanics were uneventful with some turbulence and slight airspeed variations. After reaching approximately 2;500 - 3;000 ft. MSL we began experiencing moderate turbulence; and gains and losses in airspeed in excess of 10 - 15 kt. but I was able to maintain airspeed with normal throttle inputs. At approximately 3;000 ft. MSL with 1;000 ft. climb to go; we experienced a rapid decrease of 20 - 30 kt. and we received a stick shaker for approximately 1 second but by then I had advanced the power to max and the airspeed shot back up 30+ kt. in less than a second and our climb rate rapidly increased. During that time I asked the FO to engage the autopilot and simultaneously ATC directed a frequency change but the turbulence made it difficult for the FO to do either. We finally got the AP (Autopilot) on; changed frequency; and the FO informed them we experienced the microburst / windshear and had exceeded the assigned altitude by approximately 300 ft. They advised us that was not a problem; attempted to vector us back to Runway 09; but I insisted for vectors to Runway 10C to not go back through that area of weather again. We briefed and flew an uneventful landing to Runway 10C.",,"I was the pilot monitoring for this flight. Prior to descent all briefings were completed; along with discussions about the gusty conditions going into ORD. The visibility was above the required minimums and the ceiling was about 800 ft. We were vectored for the ILS 9L approach. All checklists were completed and we were cleared to land. After we passed the 1;000 ft. call we broke out of the clouds and could see the runway. At about 600 ft. AGL the Tower provided "microburst alert 2 miles from 9L." The Captain who was the pilot flying then called a go-around and we were asked why we were going around from the Tower. I advised it was due to the microburst alert and they provided me a Departure frequency.As we climbed out we cleaned up on speed; retracting the gear and flaps in order. When I set the clean maneuver speed it was just over 205 kt. and we entered into moderate turbulence. In the turbulence I was unable to read the radio frequency on the radio control panel to contact Departure. As we were climbing well above 3;000 ft. I observed a loss of about 35 kt. of airspeed from wind shear without any indication on the navigation display; with a subsequent momentary activation of the stick shaker. The pilot flying was already hand-flying and had begun the recovery procedure and I observed the airspeed returning. We then climbed through 4;000 ft. to approximately 4;300 ft. due to the recovery from the wind shear. I was then able to contact ATC and told them we were returning to 4;000 ft. and that we had experienced wind shear above 3;000 ft. They provided vectors for ILS 9L but due to the conditions we requested the ILS 10C. We made the approach into ORD with out any further issues.",,"B737 flight crew reported encountering a wind shear on final approach and executed a go-around; subsequently safely landing on a different runway.",

I was conducting OE for the First Officer (FO). This was to be the FO's first takeoff as PF (Pilot Flying). We were originally going to use runway XX; but at some point; the winds had shifted sufficiently; so we were advised by ATC that we would be departing on runway XY. Takeoff data was obtained for Runway XY; and do due to variability of winds; we decided to use max power for the takeoff. Engine start was normal; the after start checklist was completed normally; and we taxied out for departure. We were cleared for takeoff; and there was [an aircraft] on final. Apparently; it's a slight uphill gradient from taxiway onto the runway because I had to carry power to keep the aircraft moving; on the order of around 30% N1 rpm. Since we were already cleared for takeoff; I left that power in as I transferred control and told [the First Officer] it was his aircraft. The aircraft was aligned with the runway when I told the FO it was his aircraft. He continued to advance the throttles; engaged TOGA; and I split my attention between looking outside and monitoring the engine instruments. While checking how well the FO was tracking centerline; I noticed the aircraft drifting left of centerline. Not knowing if the FO was correcting; and seeing that I must take immediate corrective action; I applied right rudder. The aircraft continued to drift left. I added more rudder then looked down to see the right engine at max power; and the left engine's EPR needle indication at around the 8 o'clock position. Rejected the takeoff before RTO was armed (less than 85 knots). We returned to the gate. Maintenance met the aircraft. I spoke with the mechanics as they were diagnosing the problem. They informed me that the auto throttle system had failed a BITE test. We remained at the aircraft while [the company] and station ops determined what to do. The mechanics mentioned that they did not have anyone qualified to taxi the aircraft; or to do an engine run. Eventually; we left for the hotel. Prior to retiring for the evening; I checked in [the scheduling system]; and noted the asymmetrical thrust that we wrote up was still open; and the entry that the BITE test had failed. When I woke up; I checked the scheduling system again; and there was no mention of the BITE test failure; and only an entry that the engine passed all run up tests. In retrospect; I should have taken a screenshot of the previous night's log history.",,"Normal engine indications up to clearance for take off.

Thrust levers and engine indications advanced normally. TOGA switches were pressed; and both Thrust Levers advanced. The aircraft yawed to the left; and the FO and Captain immediately applied full right rudder to prevent going off the runway. The Captain rejected the take-off; pulled both engines to idle. The Captain reported seeing asymmetric thrust with the left engine lagging behind the right engine which had accelerated to maximum thrust. The FO was focused on rudder and runway alignment at the time of reject and did not note engine N1 at the time of reject but both throttles had advanced simultaneously after TOGA was pressed.

AGL I allowed the airspeed to decay to target airspeed minus approximately 17 kts. Prior to landing ZZZ Tower reported winds were 290 degrees at 27 gust 37 KIAS with LLWS in the area. This equated to a 34 kt. gusty crosswinds with a wintery mix of rain and snow. Preceding aircraft had reported gains of 15 KIAS below 100 ft. We had mitigated these risks by reviewing and briefing as a crew wind shear avoidance and go-around procedures as we transitioned to land at approximately 100 ft. the airspeed began to increase (as reported) and I retarded the throttles slightly then; almost instantaneously; the airspeed dropped rapidly from 156 KIAS to approximately 139 KIAS; although the First Officer (FO) (who was PM on the approach) remembers seeing as low as minus 20 kts. or 135 KIAS. They immediately called out 'Airspeed; Airspeed' which alerted me to the unexpected loss of airspeed. Now at around 40 ft. I added power to increase airspeed then; just as rapidly as the airspeed decayed; it returned to target plus approximately 3 KIAS. As the aircraft was now 20 ft. above the runway; on center line and in the TDZ so I elected to continue to land followed to an uneventful taxi to park. The entire event lasted less than 3 seconds and speaks to the high quality of the pilot group.

This was a training flight with a new First Officer (FO); and we briefed extensively well before the top of descent; including all wind shear precautions (with an emphasis on cockpit indications of severe wind shear; i.e. unannunciated wind shear) and stabilized approach criteria. Line Check Airman (LCA) was Pilot flying (PF); and well-supported by excellent; highly-experienced new FO as PM. Saturated Approach Controller gave us a late turn on to localizer; cleared us for the approach; and Tower reported 'multiple reports of wind shear at 100 ft.; including plus 15 kts'. At approximately 150 ft.; we encountered a decreasing performance event of 15 kts.+ airspeed loss (NOT gain; as was reported by Tower); PM called 'airspeed; airspeed'; 'AIRSPEED LOW' EICAS appeared briefly; PF added appropriate power and landed uneventfully. In hindsight; there was no reactive 'Wind shear' warning; when there probably should have been with that level of decreasing performance and airspeed. The successful outcome in spite of these threats was the result of excellent leadership by the Captain; a very highly experienced and capable; well-trained and well-prepared new FO; a thoroughly briefed approach; and the highest degree of professionalism by the combined cockpit crew working together.",,"B767 flight crew reported momentary airspeed loss on approach due to windshear conditions.",

We were in the process of unloading luggage for Aircraft X with a belt loader lined up to the aft compartment and 2 luggage carts lined up to the belt loader. Myself and 1 agent were scanning and loading bags onto the belt loader and 1 agent in the aft stacking luggage. We were moving bags from one of the carts to the forward compartment when I noticed the beacon suddenly started flashing. I made several comments about it to my Agent. I then noticed the aircraft parked at Gate XX had its strobe lights on; so I assumed this may be due to the lowered visibility conditions. Shortly after the beacon turned on; while still loading bags; I began noticing an uptick in noise.I knew the APU was already running; so I thought what I was hearing was the air condition system kicking on. I quickly realized that it was sounding more like an engine; but figured it must be from the plane on [Gate] XX with the strobe lights. I moved to the other side of the aircraft near Engine #2 and noticed it was fully spooling. I see no wing walkers. Nobody with wands standing at the aft of the aircraft giving the engines running signal. Nothing. I immediately called over the Supervisor and they had nothing to offer other than agreeing with me when I said I would be filing a report on this as soon as I get home. I then went into the flight deck to speak with the 2 mechanics and explain to them that they just had an engine spooling while we were servicing the aircraft and that I will be filing a safety report. The one Mechanic; asked me if you saw the beacon on; wouldn't you assume the engines running? I simply said you can explain your side when the time is necessary and have a good day. To recap; an engine was started within feet of one of my agents working in the bin of the aircraft. Had they started Engine #1; this may have been a much more gruesome outcome. They had zero spotters. Nobody waving wands warning of an engine running. We had a belt loader and 2 carts next to the aircraft; yet another Mechanic who showed up told my Agent they didn't see us working on the flight. I took pictures from all angles of the gate and challenge anyone to not notice the equipment. Then; the completely unbothered response and unbelievable disregard for the seriousness of the situation by the mechanics was frankly concerning. As professionals that have access to flight decks and aircraft turbine engines; any display of reckless behavior without immediate remorse should be terminated from their position. I unfortunately didn't get a picture or video of the engine running as I was busy trying to get a Supervisor to the gate as soon as possible.

Returned to gate. Pushed back in ONT for late night departure. Upon call for taxi; controller instructed us to take Taxiway V and then N; cross 26R; closed runway; and hold short of 26L. I turned left on [Taxiway] N which is 'normal' but I was supposed to taxi right on N. 'Flight attendants be seated for departure;' announcement was made and Before-Takeoff Checklist complete. As turning corner onto [Taxiway] W to cross 26L; noticed unlit barrier blocking taxiway. Came to an abrupt stop; notified ATC; and agreed we had room for a turn to rejoin correct taxi route. Called back to forward FA (Flight Attendant) to double-check that everyone was OK and was informed that he had still been standing and may be injured. Agreed to return to gate and subsequently learned that an aft Flight Attendant might also be injured.Expectation bias to the 'usual' taxi route to the runway. Had flown the exact flight 1 week prior. Aware of the non-normal operation due to a runway closure but missed the recent additional taxiway closure; requiring an alternate route. It is a very short taxi; and I had briefed the flight attendants as such. The unlit barricade wasn't seen until the very last possible moment. I am very proactive in repeating taxi instructions to my flying partner. I thought I had repeated correctly. Very short taxi and task saturation; so completing pre-takeoff checks prior to taxi in this case would probably have helped. In addition; if the barrier had been illuminated we would have seen much sooner.",,"We pushed back from Gate XX at about XA:42 local time. We were instructed to push tail east and the Ground pushed us tail west; which neither of us noticed. After engine start we were issued instructions to taxi N1 Uniform to cross 26L and hold short of 26R. We taxied instead straight ahead towards Taxiway W; after which the controller issued instructions to turn onto Taxiway V which we both commented was odd not yet realizing we'd gone the wrong direction. During this time the before takeoff flows and checklists were also being accomplished; including seating the flight attendants for departure. Very shortly after the Before-Takeoff Checklist; Captain saw an unlit barrier at Taxiway W and brought the aircraft to a quick stop. On the taxi back to the proper route for Runway 26R the Captain talked to the flight attendants who informed him 2 of them had been up and were injured so we did a gate return.To mitigate this type of incident in the future 2 items come to mind. On a short taxi accomplishing flight control checks and before takeoff items before taxiing would likely have mitigated this. Paying more careful attention to taxiway closure NOTAMs and which way they had pushed the aircraft as well.

I observed a jet rolling down the runway to the southwest at FHB; Fernandina Beach; an uncontrolled field; off our left side. As I watched I anticipated that he would be talking to the same Approach Controller we were. He lifted off and began a runway heading climb. At this time the Approach Controller asked if we had JAX in sight. We both looked right to confirm JAX still in sight. I looked back to the left and acquired the jet in a climbing right turn approximately 500 below us at 1 mile away. We then received a TA showing him 200 ft. below us. Our trajectory was such that he passed behind us at our altitude at a near distance; as we turned to the right to join final for Runway 26. I saw the nose of the jet with his lights illuminated at a close range. It looked like a cover photo from Flying Magazine. The Approach Controller stated he was not talking to him after issuing us the traffic warning.Had that aircraft had an inoperative transponder; an ADSB malfunction; visibility been different; or we been just a few second later; the outcome may have been different. He was in a climbing right turn; VFR; and most likely we were blocked from his vision by the upper cockpit ceiling of the other aircraft until he had closed to within a mile and was nearly 90 degrees to us in trajectories. I received a telephone number for Approach Control from Ground and initiated a call with the JAX Approach Manager. Person A called back later to say the distance was less than 1/2 a mile at our altitude; and this is an ongoing problem with this field. She also stated she would bookmark the tape at this spot and email me a copy. I have not received a copy as of this writing. In this situation a mid-air collision is highly probable. The traffic warning issued by JAX ATC; while as prompt as it could be; would not have assisted in acquiring or avoiding this traffic. We never heard the other aircraft on our frequency.Unfamiliarity with the local traffic area. As airlines pilots we only have our Jeppesen charts and flight release to provide very limited info in regards to this immediate traffic conflict. The pop ups occur directly below flight path. Visiting GA pilots. An immediate solution would be to issue a NOTAM prohibiting a pop up IFR departure from this field; as it should easily be within radio range of JAX. An additional item could be included on the ATIS/AWOS to prevent the pop up VFR departures from an immediate westerly turn on course due to traffic/ airspace conflict. Perhaps this airspace needs a redesign to prohibit the possibility of a mid-air collision or near miss in the future; such as NRB or CRG has. There has been a noticeable increase of traffic to this field in recent years.As well; the AFD should be updated to prohibited Right turn / West Turn departures into the conflicting JAX protected airspace. A Tower would be the safest course of action at FHB to mitigate this in normal business hours. I'm aware of the departure procedure or warnings issued to FHB traffic; at large; only locally. The traffic area to local JAX flyers does not reach the affluent fast traffic with pop up IFR or VFR westbound jets that are not familiar with this area. This conflict was too close to risk any single life we had on board; much less the 198 souls traveling collectively on us.",,"On vectors to final for Runway 26 JAX in VFR conditions Captain stated he observed a jet at Fernanadia Airport on the takeoff roll to our left. From my seat I could not observe any of this. Shortly following his observation JAX Approach asked if we had the JAX airport in sight. We both looked to 2 o'clock; confirmed JAX was in sight; and Approach cleared us for the visual approach to Runway 26. Immediately after clearance the Captain observed the other jet traffic in a climbing right turn tracking on course to collide with us or near miss at best. Simultaneously JAX Approach issued a traffic alert; and our TCAS system generated a TA advisory. No RA was generated; but it was very close and behind us traffic passed.It was afternoon so the sun may have impaired the other aircraft pilot's vision; and acquiring a visual for him may have been blocked by his aircraft's upper panel. The Captain called JAX Approach and was told the distance between the two aircraft was .5 mi. The climbing aircraft was a VFR popup so prohibiting a climbing westward turn on takeoff from Fernandia airport would be a good idea. JAX Approach informed the Captain this is a trouble spot for this reason. The proximity to JAX I'm sure would allow radio contact on the ground from JAX Approach so this could be controlled better.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported a NMAC with a VFR jet departing from an uncontrolled field just outside Class C airspace.",

We heard an aircraft say they were on base. We did not hear a runway (rwy) associated with the call. We were cleared for takeoff and began our takeoff roll. Then we heard high and continuing. We did not hear the rwy associated with the call. Tower immediately told us to reject. I had not called 80kts but the max brakes applied themselves so we were above 72 kts when we rejected. We never saw the other aircraft but we did see his shadow as he passed over us. Taxi off the active and then back to the gate were both uneventful. We refueled; refiled and departed two hrs later.  Cause-Personally; I believe the tower controllers lost situational awareness of the aircraft in and around their own airspace. As a result; they cleared us to takeoff when another plane was on final.Suggestions-NOT CAUSAL - Standard procedures. Several times; Tower cleared airplanes to line up and wait after the Citation or GulfStream that is on one final lands. Maybe that's legal; but I've never heard it before and it leaves room for confusion for one; such as myself; that doesn't know the type of every plane flying. I don't know the legality; but I believe they should wait until the landing traffic has actually landed before direct the waiting traffic to line up and wait. CAUSAL - Comms. Tower ignored or didn't hear repeated calls from the plane calling base and then high on glide slope. That plane finally caused Tower to direct us to reject our takeoff. At all levels; missing calls occasionally happens but occurrences are decreased if procedures and comms are standardized and when there are two or more people listening.

Over the mountains; the fuel gauge began to indicate losing fuel rapidly; a low fuel warning light activated; and moments later we lost all Nav/Com/transponder/ADS-B out. I took over flying duties while a back seat passenger Person B (Commercial/Instrument rated pilot) accessed his tablet with Foreflight while Person A tried to diagnose the issue; including reducing electrical load and attempting to regain power. Believing that we had lost our alternator and had been on ship's battery power; I made the decision that we were in an emergency situation and asked Person B to provide vectors and safe altitudes based on his GPS equipped tablet. Person B accessed his hand-held transceiver while I continued to fly using the Garmin GI275 w/ battery back-up. Not knowing how long the battery back-up had been keeping the AI and DG operating; nor how long or how accurately I could trust the TC; I decided that we needed to get down and to ZZZ1 as soon as possible. Person A established contact on the handheld; [requested priority handling] (per my instruction as PIC); and provided position & altitude information based on his tablet. Following roughly; but offset from; the RNAV XX approach; we descended towards ZZZ2; making visual contact with the ground several miles out from ZZZ1. I saw Runway XX from a bit over a mile while at Traffic Pattern Altitude. The flight ended with a normal landing and long role-out. I believe I did all the right things given what we knew at the time. I believe we did a fair job of using all available resources; including cockpit resource management between the three of us. We checked the battery voltage on the ground; it had gone down to ~15 volts (nominal 24 volts). The maintenance shop is still looking to find out what happened to ship's power and why we never saw a 'volts' warning light when (putatively) we lost the alternator / charging system I highly recommend all flights into IMC carry tablets with GPS and hand-held radios.

This flight; its details; and all the events in managing the situation; was the subject of another report.One specific subject that needs highlighting; and its own report; was the decision not to prep for an evacuation; and exactly what 'Prepping for an Evacuation' meant for us as the Flight Crew; versus what it meant to the Purser and other Flight Attendants.During the flight in question; I gave three different briefings - the first after we had to operate Engine No. 1 at reduced power (so the flight attendants had an awareness an abnormality was occurring; but we were still continuing to ZZZ as planned); the second after the abnormality started trending worse (so it was increasingly possible we might divert with little notice or even [request priority handling]); and the third after the In-Flight Shut Down; which occurred during descent on the arrival into ZZZ.During this third briefing; I made the decision; and briefed the Purser; that they do not need to prepare the cabin for an evacuation. A single-engine flaps 15 landing was planned; and with approximately 7;200 ft. of calculated landing distance needed on a 12;000 ft. runway; it seemed like the appropriate decision. In reflecting upon FOM guidance after the event; I also feel not prepping for an evacuation complied with our manual's guidance. Per FOM X.XX.X; cabin preparation may not be required if aircraft control was expected to be maintained through alternate or redundant systems and procedures; and the situation was not expected to worsen. This applied to our flight. Also per the manual; even without prepping for an evacuation; the Flight Attendants should still modify their cabin service; review checklists; and be prepared for an unplanned evacuation if the situation worsens. FOM X.XX.Y continues to describe the types of situations that warrant prepping the cabin for an evacuation (bent/scraping of metal; fire; gear collapse; ditching; or crash). We obviously expected none of this to occur.After we parked at the gate; the Purser came up to the flight deck and expressed surprise that I did not have them prep for an evacuation. I explained why - we basically performed a normal landing at a faster than normal airspeed. She said that she thought 'Prepping for an Evacuation' would have changed her procedures from expecting a normal landing to reviewing evacuation procedures and checklists; and being ready at her jump seat to initiate or perform an evacuation if needed.Besides thinking that our flight attendants should ALWAYS be prepared at their jump seat to perform an unplanned evacuation at every landing; the disparity between what she thought 'Prep for an Evacuation' meant and what I thought it meant was stark and alarming. My guidance says it includes briefing of Passengers; ensuring everything is stowed; and expecting to use the Brace! Brace! Brace! command prior to touchdown; among other duties. She thought it simply meant being a little more mentally ready at her jump seat.I would not want to have my Flight Attendants think a mental review of evacuation procedures is adequate 'prep' when my guidance states the Passengers will be fully briefed and in the 'brace' position upon touchdown instead. Obviously; this was my experience with only one Flight Attendant. It is possible her view on communications of expectations; and her duties; in an urgent situation is not shared by every other Flight Attendant here. But it is certainly worth being sure that the Flight Attendant's manual and training matches ours in case she is not the only one.",,,,"B737 Captain reported multiple #1 Engine Oil Filter Bypass lights Illuminated in flight.

While waiting for the passenger;  FBO at ZZZ advised that the passenger's acquaintance was the owner of their own Cirrus Vision Jet stationed at ZZZ. The acquaintance had requested their line service go into his hanger and retrieve a small aviation life raft with associated life jackets to be transported with the passenger on the trip to ZZZ1 in preparation for a future trip in their own [aircraft]. FBO's line service delivered the raft and jackets to our aircraft before the passenger arrived.Initially we thought of the potential HAZMAT issue that having the raft aboard our aircraft might create. We looked in the company HAZMAT manual for some guidance but did not find any specific prohibition regarding a life raft. We did find listed in the Appendix X of the HAZMAT manual an exception for the self inflating life jackets being among the items that are permitted so we had no concerns about the jackets. We placed a call into the Chief Pilot on duty to clarify or confirm that the life raft would or would not be permitted; but the Chief Pilot was busy with other demands and did not respond to us before departure time.We made the decision to carry the raft as requested based on the logic that -It was approved for use in the owner's aircraft (the Cirrus Vision Jet) and it was very similar to; and much smaller than the rafts we carry aboard the Phenom for the same purpose. Appendix X of the HAZMAT manual allows certain exceptions of other devices that use or contain compressed gas of various kinds and we figured this raft is no different in that respect. Lastly; the company HAZMAT manual it is mentioned that the exceptions listed in Appendix D of the HAZMAT manual is not all encompassing and the company reserves the right to modify the list within the limits of the hazardous materials regulations. I assumed that had we successfully contacted the Chief Pilot that the end result would be the approval to carry the raft based on the above reasoning. That section is quoted here."DG/HM Exceptions - Certain materials which are normally regulated as dangerous goods are excepted from the HMR (Hazardous Material Regulations). They are set forth in Appendix X; DG/HM Exceptions of this manual and 49 CFR 175.10. Appendix X does not cover all DG/HM Exceptions as listed in the HMR. While the listing in Appendix X covers exceptions that the Company typically may encounter; the Company reserves the right to use any exceptions allowed in the HMR.'After the flight was completed the Chief Pilot did contact me and clarified that the raft should not have been transported due to the cylinder of compressed gas used to inflate the boat. This event was caused by the unexpected request to carry a life raft; and our incorrect interpretation of the HAZMAT manual details. Obviously we pilots could use a more thorough understanding of HAZMAT exceptions and the associated details regarding transporting items items that are very similar to typical and approved aircraft equipment. This event to us seemed like a very reasonable; logical; and acceptable action. Of course we know now that our assumption was incorrect.",,"Flight crew departed with items of HAZMAT that belonged in owner's private aircraft. Specifically; 4 life jackets and one small 4-person raft. Upon arrival at destination crew retrieved and unloaded life rafts about the same time a voice mail was received informing us the items are prohibited. While waiting for owner's spouse; FBO line crew approached the aircraft and told crew that the owner who owns his own plane had forgotten the life raft and life jackets that belonged in his aircraft; and requested crew carry them on board to deliver at destination where plane was parked. Crew checked the FOM and the HAZMAT manual and did not see where they were explicitly prohibited. Crew called and relayed the situation to Chief Pilot who offered to call back with information. In the meantime the items were strapped in the cabin to the aft seat.  Passenger arrived late and crew did revisit the HAZMAT discussion and did not call Chief Pilot back to further press for an answer.Crew took an unnecessary risk by not confirming whether the items were HAZMAT or not. A few extra minutes of greater persistence reaching someone with an answer would probably not have caused the perceived delays to subsequent revenue flights. Just because something is not specifically prohibited does not mean it's therefore permitted.  Anything that appears to be HAZMAT probably is and requires a quality effort to receive further approval from the company. Slow down; take a delay if necessary to mitigate the risk of serious injury to personnel; passengers; or the aircraft.",,"EMB-505 flight crew reported they transported prohibited Hazmat cargo.

We thought that there was a fuel leak because of the rapid fuel flow out of the left tank. The First Officer (FO) continued to fly the aircraft while I ran the Engine Fuel Leak QRH. We briefly discussed continuing straight to ZZZ1 but the weather was better in ZZZ and the rate of fuel loss out of the left side was very concerning to us. While I ran the QRH the FO [requested priority handling] and requested vectors back to ZZZ. The rapid loss led us to confirm a fuel leak in the QRH which led us to shutting down the number one engine. We continued to an uneventful single engine landing in ZZZ. After securing the engine we became aware the cross feed valve was open. I know I pointed at it in the QRH and verified it closed. I did not see a dim blue light and did not expect it to be open; because the only time it is open is when I open it. While we did discuss the issue at hand before delving into the QRC we felt a great urgency to act quickly due to the very rapid loss of fuel. A longer safety pause would have been more appropriate. The FO did a great job flying the plane and handling the radios but the approach environment is very distracting.I left the checklist to get ATC SOB count after we [requested priority handling]; and again to talk to the Flight Attendants (FAs) when they felt the plane turning around. Better managing distractions during critical junctures of the checklist would have gone a long way. I feel like I have good working knowledge of the 737 fuel systems; and know that one pump can overpower the others and the high power setting and fuel flow was the reason why the draw on the left side was so alarming. In retrospect there were a number of opportunities to trap this error before becoming an undesirable aircraft state. Fatigue may have been a contributing factor as this incident occurred on daylight savings day. I had a hard time falling asleep and woke up at XA:30 AM body time. My watch estimated my sleep for the night as 4 hours 13 minutes. I was tired that day and using caffeine to get me home. I have learned a lot from previous company guidance on this issue and never wanted to be the one to go down this rabbit hole. Look out for tunnel vision; confirmation bias; don't rush!",,"Shortly after completing the after takeoff checklist the Captain noticed that fuel was depleting from the left fuel tank at an alarming rate. After a quick discussion we agreed that a fuel leak was suspected. I continued flying the aircraft and took over radio duties while the Captain ran the QRH for fuel leak. I [requested priority handling] and requested radar vectors back to ZZZ after a quick discussion with the Captain as the weather was significantly better there than ZZZ1. The checklist lead us to shut down the left engine and we prepared for a single-engine approach and landing. While on downwind our jump seater noticed that our cross feed valve was in the open position and neither the Captain nor I had caught it. We were so busy and inundated with task-saturation that a step was missed in the QRH. I think we were pretty shocked to see how fast our fuel was depleting from the left side and that caused us to rush the checklist and miss key steps. The volume of radio calls and vectors kept me from doing a great job of backing up the Captain while they ran the checklist. Fatigue was definitely a contributing factor as we had an early van in ZZZ2 on the morning of daylight savings. This is a prime example of needing to slow down and take a better assessment of the situation before rushing to conclusions.",,"B737 Flight Crew reported a suspected Fuel Leak after takeoff.

During my second pass around the traffic pattern; tower cleared me for the low approach to Runway XX while I was in the left downwind. I executed a base turn and continued the turn for a short final and low pass. I slightly overshot final; putting me almost as far as taxiway. While descending through approximately 400 ft. just before the runway threshold (now lined up with XX); there was a helicopter approximately 50-100 ft. off of my right wing at my altitude. By the time I saw the helicopter; I could see there was no imminent collision; albeit it was quite close. I arrested my descent and turned slightly left. After I had already passed the position of the helicopter; tower called for me to side-step toward the river (left); so I further side-stepped; but the event was already over.I believe there were several factors that caused this near collision: There was a lot of radio traffic around the time of the event with a couple of helicopters in the airport area as well as several other aircraft coming and going. I believe the Tower Controller was possibly at the extreme of what he was capable of dealing with in terms of workload. I slightly overshot final (though this shouldn't have been a factor). My base/final were executed as a close approach as soon as I was cleared and possibly faster than what tower expected. My own situational awareness was overly focused on engine performance/instruments.Preventative measures I could do next time: Communicate clearly with tower if I plan to make a close approach during any maneuver. Do not over shoot final (even when there are no parallel runways; helicopters often use the taxiway). Do best to keep better situational awareness; though in this case; there was a lot happening in the pattern area and I did not expect the helicopter to be there based on the radio calls.",,,,"Pilot reported a NMAC event during landing low pass with a helicopter.

I touched down smoothly and continued down the runway; as I added throttle and raised the nose while still on the runway the nose wheel collapsed or retracted; the plane pitched forward with the prop striking the ground.

I reentered the airplane and turned off the gas and grabbed my hand held radio and notified the Tower of my situation. The fire trucks arrived. The firemen had an instrument that checked the heat signature of various parts of the airplane and they deemed it all normal with no fire.  The Airport Operations Manager arrived and we discussed how to get the aircraft off the runway. He was able to contact someone at Company and after awhile we went over to their hangar and lead him out to assess the situation and figure out what equipment would be necessary to move the aircraft off the runway and to the hangar area.

I later flew to him for further aerobatics instruction in my RV-4. We executed various aerobatic maneuvers including loops; pulling approximately 3-4 Gs.At the end of the lesson; my Instructor tested my upset recovery skills by putting me in an unusual attitude. I corrected too aggressively and pulled 6.5 Gs. As I did so; the rear seat collapsed; sending my Instructor into the baggage compartment. Fortunately my Instructor incurred only minor injuries; but he could have sustained severe spinal damage or; if he had been gripping the stick at the time; could have yanked back hard enough to rip the wings off.I believe the main cause was that the rear seat was not in compliance with SB 97-05-1 'Rear Seat Reinforcement'. My last condition inspection states 'carried out an annual inspection per Vans condition inspection checklist' and Van's Condition Inspection Checklist states 'Review Service Bulletins'; yet I was not informed; nor was it logged; that there were any SBs not complied with.A contributing factor is that I pulled more Gs than planned due to my inexperience with aerobatics; fear of overspeeding the plane; and an aft CG that is known to make the RV-4 sensitive to back pressure. It is possible that the 0.5 over-G contributed to the seat back failure or that the seat back failure contributed to the over-G. W&B at the time of the incident was 1;359 pounds and 65.9 inches CG.

I was on the Local Control position with my supervisor behind me working standalone Controller in Charge (CIC). Aircraft X in the left pattern for Runway XXL had been given a downwind extension to allow spacing for a departure off the runway. After there was enough space; I allowed them to turn base and cleared them for the option. At the same time a few departures and arrivals were also taking place on the parallel runway (Runway XXR); and another aircraft on the ground had called up on my frequency to notify someone pulling up to the runway that their baggage door was open. I stepped in to facilitate the discussion and ensure that the aircraft did not need to get onto the runway while maneuvering to conduct his check of the door. Another aircraft was then short-final for Runway XXR as well.After this was adequately resolved on Runway XXR; an Aircraft Y called up for a departure off XXL at the Taxiway X intersection. The Ground Control position had previously informed me that they were a departure along the Shoreline toward ZZZ1's southern airspace; so I called over the shout line to coordinate per the LOA. The Local 1 Controller was having problems understanding the coordination; so it took a few back-and-forths to clear it up. In the meantime; Aircraft X had been making a 1 mile base turn and final; and in his descent toward the runway had now dropped off the radar. Once ZZZ's Local 1 Controller finally approved the transition; I made a quick glance up at the radar and out the window; but missed seeing the Aircraft Y at a low point coming straight in and approved Aircraft Y's departure with restrictions. Unfortunately; my CIC had also not noticed the Aircraft X short-final.Aircraft X initiated a go-around while short-final 'for traffic on the runway'; and I immediately sent him on an early left crosswind to de-conflict from the departing traffic. Short of ASDE-X; I will work to be more vigilant on my scan and not be too distracted from unusual situations. The baggage door conversation and the unnatural coordination with the adjoining controller.

We leveled off at FL320 and completed the cruise check. Shortly after passing ZZZZZ intersection we received a HYD LO QTY EICAS Advisory. We immediately checked the Multi-function Flight Display (MFD) HYD page and realized the Hydraulic Fluid Quantity on System 1 was at the top of the Amber Band. As I was pilot flying; I transferred flight controls and radios to my First Officer (FO) and ran the Hydraulic System Low Quantity QRH. The QRH led us to review the Hydraulic System 1 Failure QRH on another page. As we preemptively reviewed the System Fail QRH we discussed the potential system losses and options available to us. During this time we monitored the Fluid Quantity and noticed that the Quantity continued to fall rapidly. After approximately 5 minutes; the Quantity was in the middle of the amber band and I determined failure was inevitable. We both agreed to return to ZZZ. I called ATC; [requested priority handling]; and asked to return to field. Additionally; in anticipation of Hydraulic System Loss I commanded my FO to fly at 240 Kts. to avoid structural damage to the landing gear doors if and when they failed to the open position. ATC was advised of this speed restriction and gave us direct ZZZZZ1 for the ZZZZZ2 3. I called the Flight Attendant (FA) and gave her a briefing; indicating an arrival in 30 minutes and anticipation of a normal landing. At this point I received a ACARS from Dispatch inquiring why we were turning around. I advised we were returning for a potential HYD 1 Leak. ATC asked if we would need special preparations on the ground and I advised we may need a tug off the runway as we may not have steering capability. At this point we received a HYD SYS1 FAIL EICAS Caution and ran the applicable QRH. This was accompanied by AIL SYS1 INOP. Dispatch responded saying that Maintenance was wondering where we were indicating the HYD leak. I responded to Dispatch that we had HYD SYS1 FAIL and were a [priority handling] aircraft. I then briefed the STAR and approach to my FO and we discussed potential adverse outcomes and solutions associated with the system failures. At this point I took back flight controls and flew the STAR to an uneventful flaps 45 landing after manual gear deployment. After landing we must have regained some hydraulic fluid from the accumulators as I regained some system functionality; including steering. I slowed to approximately 10 Kts. or less and exited the runway at a high speed exit where I came to a stop after crossing the threshold. Tower gave us a frequency to communicate with Operations and Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) in order to confirm that the aircraft was safe. Additionally; Maintenance drove up the aircraft and inspected our Hydraulic System before we were given the OK to tug back to gate with passengers on board. I made an announcement after clearing the runway explaining the situation to the Passengers and ensuring them of their safety. The Passengers disembarked the aircraft normally at gate XXX and we were given a new aircraft at XXY to ultimately complete the flight to ZZZ1.Person A and Person B both acted with a high level of professionalism and played a critical role in the safe return of our priority handling aircraft.",,,,"EMB-145 Captain reported receiving a HYD LO QTY EICAS Advisory in cruise.

We briefed the threat as I experienced the same EICAS four months ago. We briefed to monitor the Fuel Synoptic after we got the Fuel Low Center EICAS to monitor the Fuel Balance. In cruise once we got that EICAS we monitored the Fuel Synoptic at XA29. The Fuel Values were (63.4/1.8/64.0) (L/C/R) for an Imbalance of 600 pounds. The Left Engine had a fuel flow of 300 pounds higher per hour. At XB13 it was (58.2/2.0/59.3) for an imbalance of 1;100 pounds. At XB42 it was (54.5/1.7/56.0) for an imbalance of 1;500 pounds. At XC19 it was (49.0/0.2/52.2) for an imbalance of 3;300 pounds. We discussed why the Center Tank Fuel was at 0.2 when the fuel scavenge was not supposed to operate yet; due to the main tank fuel being above the onset value per the FM system section. Fuel Imbalance EICAS annunciated; and we accomplished the checklist; made an ELB write up. Contacted Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss the issue; they advised to keep monitoring and we gave Maintenance Control all the data above. During re-balancing we reviewed the Fuel Leak checklist and started monitoring the progress pages for totalizer fuel and calculated fuel as well as fuel remaining at ZZZ. After re-balancing we saw the imbalance numbers start to rise again. At XD12 the fuel was (42.4/0.0/44.8) for an imbalance of 2;400 pounds. At XD42 the fuel was (38.5/0.0/41.8) for an imbalance of 3;300 pounds. The :30 rate of difference was 900 pounds for XD42 and then at XE12 was 1;000 pounds. All other indications were normal the fuel totalizer and calculated fuel difference started at 1;300 pounds and went down to 400 pounds over this time period. The fuel remaining at touchdown remained consistent with our flight conditions. The HOWGOZIT fuel and the time reflected our flight. The Relief Pilot came up; and I went back to view door 3L and 4L for any sign of a Fuel Leak Spray from the Left Engine. No Spray was observed. We accomplished the checklist for Fuel Imbalance again and notified Dispatch and Maintenance Control and gave them more data and discussed diverting into ZZZZ if the :30 fuel rate of difference exceeded 1;000 pounds. After the second re balancing the imbalance only increased to 1;100 pounds for the remainder of the flight. All other values and indications were consistent with the flight (totalizer/calculated/fuel reaming at touchdown/HOWGOZIT). We decided to not blindly follow the Fuel Leak checklist and shut down the engine for just the 1;000-pound limit; as all other values and indications were within tolerances and fuel remaining and the HOWGOZIT numbers were reflective of our flight plan. The fuel imbalance; fuel totalizer calculated values did not increase after the second re balancing. Flight landed uneventful at ZZZ.

We did not notice any noise from the extending gear and any speed reduction for the drag which should be occurring. At approximately 1400-1500 ft. we initiated a go-around (soft-go) and notified Tower we had an Unsafe Gear Indication. Tower instructed us to climb to 3000 ft.; runway heading. After the go-around the ECAM displayed landing gear gravity extension. I assigned the First Officer (FO); Pilot Flying and ATC duties; and that they should [request priority handling]. I began the Gravity Extension Procedure that just said to wait 120 seconds so I got the QRH out for the procedure and attempted to inform the Flight Attendants (FAs) but they didn't respond to my initial chimes. I also made a PA informing the passengers that we had gone around for a landing gear issue and would be working to extend the gear and that the aircraft would be getting loud with the gear extended. Before we returned to ZZZ; I proceeded with the QRH procedure for Gravity Extension and it was successful. We got 3 green lights and 3 green on the ECAM with the doors open. I then contacted the FAs and informed them that we had successfully lowered the landing gear; it was safe and locked and we would be returning to ZZZ for a precautionary landing. I then made another PA to the passengers also informing them that the landing gear was safe and locked and we were returning to land. We told ATC that we were ready to return and that we would be unable to clear the runway after landing and would require a tug. We then received radar vectors to final for Runway YYC and proceeded with a normal approach and landing to a full stop on the runway. I made a PA for everyone to remain seated and that Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles were going to be inspecting the aircraft.We did after landing and engine shut down checklist. We were then informed of an extended wait for the tug so I made a PA informing the passengers and told them that they could use the lavs but I would give 5 minute notice for when they needed to be seated. After the tug arrived; Maintenance installed all gear locks and tried for about 15-20 to raise the gear doors for tow; but were unsuccessful. We were then towed to the gate and completed aircraft shutdown. I want to acknowledge the performance of FO who did an outstanding job flying the aircraft and communicating with ATC allowing me to accomplish the checklist and inform the FAs and passengers of our progress; I was also impressed with the excellent job of FAs; when informed of our situation I appreciated their prompt understanding and knowledge.",,"Upon approach to Runway XXL in ZZZ; everything was going as normal. I was the Pilot Flying and we were configuring the aircraft for landing at the FAF. I requested gear down and after the Captain lowered the gear; there was no audible indication that the gear was moving. Shortly thereafter; a Caution Message chimed that there was a landing gear disagree situation. A go-around was executed and vectors were provided by ATC. The Captain assigned me as Pilot Flying (PF) and to communicate with ATC while they performed the ECAM actions and QRH follow ups. A gravity gear extension worked perfectly. We [requested priority handling] with ATC but informed the cabin crew and passengers of a precautionary landing. The landing was uneventful except that we stopped on the runway as our nose wheel steering was INOP due to compliance with the ECAM actions. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was near the runway waiting for us and the runway was shut down while we waited for a Tow Team to pull us to the gate.After about 30 minutes of waiting on the runway; the Tow Team arrived with Airport Operations and Company Maintenance. At the request of Maintenance; I dropped the gear pins out of the cockpit. Maintenance was concerned about the gear doors rubbing the surface during the tow to the terminal and asked us to do abnormal procedures that I was confused with because of passengers still being on board. It was very clear that they were extremely concerned about the doors rubbing the surface. Everything that was done was at the direction of the Maintenance personnel who was connected to the aircraft via headset. Numerous announcements were made to the passengers by the Captain as well as communication to the Flight Attendants. We were eventually towed to the gate after being on the runway for 1 hour. Extended onboard delay procedures were complied with but not communicated to Dispatch. I will have to say that ATC; ARFF; Airport OPS; Maintenance; and the Flight Attendants all performed magnificently and I believe the passengers saw this as well.In my own words; this event was performed beautifully by everyone involved. It is because of our constant training that this actually felt like a routine event. Everyone was calm and I believe that is thanks to everyone in the Training Department. I would also like to thank the cabin crew manager for meeting us at the gate for checking on the whole crew's emotional well being. Landing Gear Issue resulting in Gravity Gear Extension; extended wait on the runway resulting in lengthy runway closure; extended wait on the runway resulting in an extended onboard delay; and abnormal non-published procedures directed by Maintenance personnel causing slight concern from flight deck crew. This event was performed beautifully by everyone involved.

The flight was already delayed three hours. While conducting the walk around; I observed a significant amount of Fuel Dripping from beneath the Right Engine. I can appreciate that this could be due to cooler temperatures and seals contracting given the time of year; however we had some time prior to departure and it was a greater rate of fluid drip than I was comfortable with (approximately 3 drips/second). Furthermore; it was not particularly cold outside; so it presented differently than normal cold weather-related fuel drips.Once I got back to the flight deck; the First Officer (FO) pointed out to me that the accumulator was below 1;200 PSI. This seemed low despite the FM pre-flight value of 1;000 PSI to contact Maintenance (FM XXXX). To give us more SA on the status of the Parking Brake Accumulator; I pressurized the Hydraulic System and then turned the pumps back off. While the brake pressure did go up to approximately 3;000 PSI (normal); it depleted quite quickly and got to the 800p PSI maximum in about 3 minutes - well inside of the 30 minute FM limit (FM XXXY). Having experienced similar in the past; this was presenting as a possible accumulator pre-charge leak. A report entry was made for both the Fuel Leak (LP# XXXXXXX) and the Accumulator Pressure anomaly (LP# XXXXXXY).Maintenance Control responded to the flight deck and stated that they needed the flight deck to move some actuators.  The First Officer and I vacated the flight deck and proceeded to the jet bridge. At this point; the aircraft was almost fully boarded; it became incredibly loud on the jet bridge like that of an aircraft parking next to you. However; there was not an aircraft parking next to us - it was our mechanics motoring the Right Engine. I immediately went to the flight deck to inquire as to why an Engine was being run with Passengers onboard and I was told that they were motoring; not running it because they were not introducing fuel. In my available source document information (FOM XXYY); running an engine for a maintenance purpose without fuel introduction is not really defined.  Yet a safety risk does exist with Ground Personnel moving around an aircraft (especially a delayed one).Shortly thereafter; the Technicians came out of the flight deck and stated that the leak subsided with the engine motoring. There was a subtle assertion made; which I did not appreciate; about writing-up engine leaks because we get paid to run them. I can assure you that the add pay associated with an engine run DID NOT factor whatsoever into my decision to write-up the original fuel leak observed during the walk around.Upon reentering the flight deck; the Technician stated that he was going to sign off the Engine and for me to reject the accumulator write up (or Cancel reports in ACARS). I asked why and he stated that it was good to go. I asked if he was going to take the time to sign off the Engine; to which he responded in the affirmative. So I said that he could then do similar with the accumulator if it was truly good to go. He then; again; said that I could just also reject the write up. To which I said I would not and that he could affirm its operational status through signing off the accumulator report entry as an Ops Check Normal. He then reminded me that it was shift change and all it would do would further delay the flight. I did not acquiesce and stated that we would wait for shift change to occur. Given the time reference to shift change; we were also left to wonder if the Technicians were really able to conduct the engine run procedure with passengers onboard or if they did not want to be delayed at the end of their shift.With the new shift in place; they determined that the pre-charge was quite low and had to increase it through a maintenance procedure. There was then a leak check that had to be performed. Again; the accumulator bled down to the maximum and; albeit within the tolerance; the Technicians further troubleshot. They confirmed that the accumulator was not holding its pre-charge and further investigation was warranted. As a result; the aircraft was taken out of service and the flight subsequently canceled due to no spare aircraft available. It is further important to note that the original report entry was ultimately cleared by a change of the entire accumulator assembly.",,,,"B737-900 Captain reported disagreement and failure to follow procedures during a maintenance delay. The aircraft was subsequently removed from service after the Captain declined to remove a valid entry from the log book. The aircraft was swapped and the flight continued with another aircraft.",

We were cleared the visual XX and needed to reach ZZZZZ at 8;500 feet for the first fix on the visual. Pilot Flying (PF) entered in a descent at 3;000 FPM which would have gotten us down a little late so rolled the vertical speed to 3;700 FPM. At approx 12;000 feet we got a GPWS terrain caution and PF adjusted vertical speed but then we got the warning and audible pull up. PF disconnected autopilot and arrested descent which then removed the warning. At no point did the terrain feel a factor as we were VFR and well above the terrain in VFR conditions. We continued the guided visual with no issue. As Pilot Monitoring (PM) I had already setup the guided visual altitudes and was checking the fixes and altitudes over as this was my first time into ZZZ. In hindsight I could have focused on suggesting getting an earlier descent or a vector away in order to get down.",,"ATC kept us high for longer than usual and we had to increase our descent rate to get on profile. I increased the rate out of 17;000 feet and passing 12;000 feet I got an Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) alarm. We were VMC and all terrain was visible.

I immediately took manual control of the aircraft and assessed the cause finding the left TRANSFER BUS OFF Annunciation accompanied by the Left SOURCE OFF Annunciation Illuminated. My copilot went to the QRH and we ran the TRANSFER BUS OFF checklist without success of regaining power to the associated bus. The procedure in this situation directs the pilots to land at the nearest suitable airport which in this case was our destination airport ZZZ. We [requested priority handling] and proceeded to ZZZ. The NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist was also run and the SOURCE OFF checklist was reviewed. Inside the final fix landing Runway XXL the smell of potential burning electrical became apparent. Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) was requested to be present on landing and the Flight Attendants were asked about the condition in the cabin where no smell was detected.The landing was uneventful and ARFF followed us to the gate as a precaution. We also directed the ground crew to stay away from the aircraft until ARFF had determined there were no hot spots within the aircraft. The Flight Attendant additionally reported after deplaning at the gate in ZZZ that earlier in the flight an oven had smelled of burning plastic and then shut off. This would have happened approximately one hour before the bus off event and was also reported to Maintenance. The crew did an excellent job of managing this mechanical event and maintaining passenger care throughout. When running the NON-ROUTINE LANDING CONSIDERATIONS checklist I decided not to inform the Flight Attendants or the passengers of the situation as we were landing at our destination airport and no further assistance was anticipated. In hindsight I feel informing the Flight Attendants would have been prudent regardless of the fact a diversion was not required.",,,,"B737-800 Captain reported on initial descent; the Autopilot Disengaged in smooth air without warning and they could smell potential burning electrical equipment.

Even the disconnected auto brake line for the #3 wheel was found accordingly on the walk around. We did read the MEL and it was in the AML; however; it was not on the paperwork due to a Maintenance entry error. The probable cause of me missing the 32-XX-XX on the paper work in addition to MEL 32-XX-XX may have been because I looked at the AML and it had 32-XX-XX on the book while reading it in the MEL. There were a lot of details to remember for this MEL procedure. In the briefing between the Captain and I; we briefed the MEL 32-XX-XX and the significance of 32-XX-XX for the before takeoff procedure for the AUTO Brake MAX to be BLUE. Going back and forth between the MEL and the AML the thing we missed was to look at the Dispatch release to see if 32-XX-XX was also added or not. Sometimes even when you look at things thoroughly; you get carried away with all the information since one leads to another and you miss out on a missing link.

At ZZZ1 flight cancelled and was given a 2nd reassignment to operate ZZZ1 ZZZ with a terminal change in ZZZ1; the flight was operating with a 1 ½ hour delay already.First leg of the flight was uneventful arriving in ZZZ we were advised that we had a 3-hour Estimated Departure Clearance Time (EDCT) back to ZZZ1. Parking in ZZZ at gate XXX. We set for 2 1/2 of our 3 hours. ATC advised us that we would probably be released early; we began our passenger boarding and I already started to look at my 117 Flight Duty Period (FDP) limits and realized that I may be getting close to needing an extension. I reached out to crew scheduling and we determined wheels up time for my limits. Dispatch released us and advised that we were good to take the remainder of our EDCT off gate.Our push crew was ready and seemed very eager to get us going; my guess is they were ready to go home as well. Just as we closed the maintenance control document and communicated to ATC for push clearance we were given EDCT extension of 1:20 mins; I had to stop the push request to reconfirm with my FDP limit on wheels up before we push. Once we determined that I was still legal with our new wheels up time Dispatch also agreed to push; we communicated again with the ground crew that we were ready to push. Our driver was chatty during the push and had made a comment that led us into thinking that we were going to be pushed back followed by a forward pull to position us for a straight-out taxi XX; up to this point normal push calls were being made by the driver and myself; the push was very smooth and controlled and professionally done; the Ramp is uncontrolled and very poorly lit; I could not see the wing walkers; only flashlights. During the straight back portion of the push we had several distractions by ATC for EDCT; Flight Attendant call of cabin secure and takeoff landing data return. The push crew advised we were clear to start as well.The aircraft came to a stop just as I requested the First Officer (FO) to start #1 eng; I noticed that we were setting for a bit longer than expected for the forward push to begin; but had allowed myself to be distracted by the takeoff data due to 6 passengers and no FWD bags; I had anticipation of needing to deal with a CG issue as well.At this point without and communications from the tug; they began to pull away from out plane; my first reaction was that he had begun to pull us forward; but I did not feel any movement; just as I glanced off to the left I noticed that the marshaller was now holding a red X (normal for a tug disconnect) as I was gathering my thoughts; the FO yelled I think we are rolling? I immediately applied toe brakes out of critical reaction. My guess is that we had rolled less than a few inches; (due to # 1 eng now running); this is when I was able to determine that the tug had been released and headset comms removed without any verbal communications from the tug driver; and very smoothly done I might add; all happened within a minute or so. I made a motion to the marshaller to reconnect the head set; the driver reconnected and asked if everything was okay? I advised him that we had not been given any communications of a disconnect or to set brakes; he made the statement that the light was red; I'm not sure how that could have been possible. He apologized for the oversight and we continued our flight without further issues. The FO was doing a wonderful job and helped identify a huge threat. Even though I had briefed threats to include long day and nonstandard EDCT's I still allowed myself to be distracted during a critical phase of push; lessons learned:Always monitor your push crew and be prepared to trap threats and errors from nonstandard procedures. Be very vigilant during times of extended delays and nonstandard operations. Even though this was all discussed with my FO; I still allowed myself to be distracted. During this crazy day; I feel I had done a good job of identifying my limitations; communicating with the FO regarding not rushing.

The run up was great; the takeoff was fine; everything else was perfectly normal. It is when I begin my preparation to come back to the airport; descending and reducing the throttle. It is when I first noticed that when I brought the RPMs down to roughly 3;700-4;000 RPM; to begin a gradual descent; is when I first noticed that it would run rough at a lower RPM. And when I reference 'roughness' in the engine it means that the engine; and subsequently the plane; began to shake vigorously. It was quickly fixed by a twist of the throttle to add some power. The rest of the pattern was a normal pattern; except that I was higher than normal because of a 737 on the parallel. When I was about a half mile away from the runway threshold; the engine began to run rough again; but this time it was more than the previous and was not fixed with a simple light twist of the throttle that would bring the RPMs up a couple hundred. I then began to manipulate the throttle and it was just stuck at 3;700 RPM; even with near full throttle it didn't do anything. I then brought it back to near idle and it was dancing all over the place. I saw a quick burst of an increase in RPM; then it decreased. I thought it was going to continue to decrease.I then switched fuel tanks and pushed the carb. heat in the see if anything was going to fix then problem; it didn't. With this terror and trouble I was having; I contacted Tower and advised them of my situation. After 10-15 seconds after the last contact with Tower; the RPMs began to act more normal and responsive to the inputs I was giving it. For the flare and touchdown; I put the throttle back into the idle 'position' and landed. Although when vacating the runway; my RPMs dropped way below the normal idle power to 1;700 RPM and it was running with a light roughness. I then; after I was clear of the runway; I tried to see if twisting the throttle clockwise to see if adding power would fix the situation; and this time it did. I think the cause of this incident was the dual carburetor system de-syncronizing or something to do with the pulley system that controls the throttle and the valve that opens and closes the fuel air mixture. Being a student solo in the cockpit and something like this occurring; I think that the decisions made might not have benefited the situation and just took some time that I could have been focusing on something else; put on a solution that was probable in my mind at the moment. I think something that would be done to prevent this from occurring would be not going to full idle when coming into land because that is when I think it is most messed up.",,,,"Pilot reported engine roughness and lack of Engine Throttle response on descent.

I elected to select VNAV as the Pilot Flying (PF) for the departure mode. After a runway change; we delayed departure for wake turbulence avoidance from a departed 757 ahead of us; which I believe caused the ride to be a little bumpier than it would have otherwise been. On climb out; our vertical speed had reached a high rate (> 3;000 fpm? But probably much higher); and as I was in the right turn off of runway I heard the VNAV altitude alert chime; I looked down at the VSD; which I quickly noticed (remembered) had the BELOW 5;000 on it. I queried the Pilot Monitoring (PM) if that first altitude was below 5;000 ft.; and the PM didn't respond. At this point I believe we were going through > 4;000 ft. with a very fast rate of closure on the altitude restriction. I said aloud; 'It's 5;000. I'm going to level'; at which point I started applying forward pressure on the yoke to level off. I didn't want to unload the airplane abruptly; so I ended up leveling off around 100-150 ft. high; and slowly corrected back down to 5;000 ft.; and made the below restriction at the waypoint; as required.I could have prepared for this altitude restriction better by using the Vertical Speed mode instead of VNAV (VFLCH) and setting the altitude selector to 5;000 ft.; then changing the altitude selector after passing the restricted waypoint; which would have given me much more precise control over the rate of ascent & level off. Specifically calling out any 'BELOW' restrictions and a plan to meet it would have made a better briefing.Contributing factors were -  The G550 has very high climb performance; especially when light. We were a relatively light weight that day; at sea level. We were quick turning. Although we didn't rush and thoroughly briefed; we may have had more time to 'think about it' and elected to brief the alternate procedure of using VS instead of VFLCH on departure. Contributing to this was increased crew focus on the runway change during taxi and wake turbulence avoidance; plus the updrafts during climb out. The PM is relatively new to the aircraft; which may have contributed to task saturation after departure; decreasing the SA (Situational Awareness) as well.",,,,"G550 Captain reported a wake turbulence encounter contributed to an altitude overshoot departing MCO in trail of a B757.",

I was able to climb above the buildings and over a hill that is parallel to the run way while in a constant left turn with full right aileron. I notified the tower that I [needed priority] due to unable to control the aircraft. At this point I had made a 180 degree turn and had gained about 1;000 feet.

No one was hurt; we exited the aircraft and pushed it off the runway to clear it for traffic. I notified the Tower that we had broken the light and glass was likely on the runway. As I was talking to the Tower the lineman who was helping us noticed that the right tailwheel spring was missing the lineman and another person looked for it on the runway but was unable to find it.

The aircraft was firmly on the ground; all three wheels; and ground speed was dropping rapidly; estimated 15-20 mph when the swerve started. Application of full right rudder was not enough to correct the left turn. I attempted to apply the right brake; but I believe that I did not get on the heel brake lever properly. The instructor in the back seat did apply the right brake; sending the aircraft to the right. At this point; I applied the left brake; which straightened the aircraft on the runway and the combination lifted the tail; resulting in a prop strike and damage to the prop spinner and cowling. When the aircraft rocked forward the ground speed was almost completely dissipated; the spinner mark on the runway was approximately 2 feet long.After striking the propeller and cowling; the aircraft returned to the normal 3-point position. Neither of us; at least at the time of the incident and writing this report; believed that we had suffered any injury. The Control Tower asked if we required assistance; and we responded that we did. We exited the aircraft and proceeded to push the aircraft clear of the runway rather than waiting for the assistance. After getting the aircraft to the ramp; we noticed the right tailwheel spring was missing. The ground crew that inspected the runway for FOD was unable to locate the missing spring. I do not know if the spring was lost on the final take-off at ZZZ1 or if it happened when the tail slapped back to the ground after the prop strike.

The aircraft landed at a small private grass strip called SLOAS which is located approximately 3 miles west of Youngstown Regional Airport; inside of our Class D airspace.

He voiced he had been trying for years without success; and was even told that smaller private strips don't receive the priority of other airports. He stated that unless pilots are familiar or have experience flying into SLOAS; there is not a good way to tell if the airport is in controlled airspace or not due to the fact it is not charted. This has happened before in the past; and after speaking to the owner of SLOAS; I believe that an airport within controlled airspace; especially being so close to Youngstown Regional (3 miles) should be charted on a VFR sectional chart.

This was the only instruction or advisory we received from Ground throughout the entire taxi. After becoming established on Bravo; behind the tug; the Captain called for the Before-Takeoff Checklist. Since this checklist requires us to reference paperwork and the FMC; the amount of time I was spending heads down was now increased.

I was still in the process of completing the checklist; but at this point I focused my full attention outside.Understanding that Aircraft X was headed on a conflicting path with our taxi route; the Captain steered our aircraft slightly to the left; to provide extra clearance; and to ensure the two aircraft remained clear of each other. From what I could tell; Aircraft X eventually became aware of the conflict and stopped. During our taxi; we were never made aware by ATC that there was an aircraft crossing into our path; nor were we given instruction to give way to the crossing aircraft.

It read; 'ECAM FUEL L TK PUMP1 LOW PR.' The action taken by ZZZ Maintenance was entered as 'Checked and approved for deferral in accordance with MEL 28-XXX Wing Tank Fuel Pump LH #1. Entered in Logbook deferral Sheet." When I reviewed MEL 28-XXX in the MEL / CDL (Configuration Deviation List) manual I immediately determined that the maintenance action recorded in the AML did not meet the requirements of the MEL. Specifically; the first step in the procedures is to inspect the circuit breaker associated with the inoperative pump - in this case; Circuit Breaker N23. If the circuit breaker is tripped there are two possible courses of action; each with associated language that must be entered in the AML. If the circuit breaker is not tripped; an entry must be made in the AML stating; 'Circuit Breaker N23 confirmed not tripped prior to application of MEL;" - emphasis mine. As previously indicated; there was no AML entry that complied with these requirements of the MEL. I examined the N23 Circuit Breaker and determined that it was not tripped now. Also; the message ECAM FUEL L TK PUMP1 LOW PR remained in the ECAM Canceled Caution Display on the Status Page.I called ZZZ and informed them that there was a problem with the MEL entry. I was instructed to tell the AMT who was already at the aircraft working on unrelated discrepancies - missing fasteners. When he came to the flight deck I informed him that there was a problem with the AML entry for the FUEL L TK PUMP1 LOW PR discrepancy. He read the AML; then said it's on MEL and it's OK. The FO (First Officer) and I then both conveyed our understanding that the MEL required an inspection of the N23 Circuit Breaker before application of the MEL and a corresponding entry in the AML that was not there. He looked briefly at the MEL procedures; then reached up and turned on the Left Wing Tank #1 Pump. I was very uncomfortable with this action since I have been trained repeatedly during 37 years of military and commercial flying to never apply power - e.g.; push in a tripped circuit breaker - to a possibly malfunctioning fuel pump due to the risk of fire. While I understand that this may be part of a maintenance procedure; the AMT was not using any kind of job card and did not discuss this action with me in advance. The aircraft was fully loaded with passengers.After about a minute the AMT noted that the N23 Circuit Breaker had not tripped. He picked up the AML and wrote; 'Circuit breaker confirmed not tripped;' on the pink page below the existing entry. Then he said it's good now and attempted to hand me the AML. I replied; "No; its not;" at which point he turned around without saying a word and quickly left the aircraft with the AML. About 20 - 30 minutes later he returned and tossed the AML onto the center instrument pedestal; saying only one word - something like 'here' or 'done' - then immediately left again. The AML now had a new entry stating that the N23 Circuit Breaker was confirmed not tripped prior to application of the MEL.I called ZZZ Maintenance to ask how that was confirmed and they told me to call Maintenance Control. I also asked them to send a Maintenance Supervisor to talk to me. I then called Maintenance Control and had a lengthy discussion with a representative who searched an aircraft database and confirmed that the aircraft had not reported any tripped circuit breakers during the previous few flights. At that point I was comfortable that the requirements of the MEL were met as best as could be done now and I accepted the aircraft. The Maintenance Supervisor arrived and we had a good discussion of the situation. We departed shortly afterward on an uneventful flight. However; I remain deeply concerned about the actions of ZZZ Maintenance in handling both the original discrepancy and the deficiencies I identified in the AML entries.Cause - the perceived desire by Maintenance to defer correcting discrepancies by applying MELs whenever possible during the day. Suggestions - strict adherence to MEL procedures.",,,,"A319 Captain reported Maintenance failed to follow procedures with applying an MEL that involved a potentially tripped circuit breaker.

Rotate required maybe twice the normal elevator force. Normal climb-out. Not certain of any excess pitch forces during climb. After takeoff; climb; and cruise; aircraft responded well to manual pitch; electric trim; and autopilot use. No other abnormal system indications. Takeoff trim setting seemed typical for aircraft weight. During preflight I had read electronic aircraft logbook entry; Day 0; stating controls were heavy during takeoff rotation and during landing flare. Maintenance corrective action mentioned a loose union at elevator feel computer pitot line - corrected.My initial thought was to continue to ZZZZ and see how the landing flare felt at normal landing weight; as the aircraft seemed to be operating normally - other than takeoff rotation. I intended to; at a minimum; write up the excess elevator force required during rotate upon arrival in ZZZZ. FO (First Officer) supported that course of action. I also discussed the possibility that an incorrect CG calculation might have the same effect. I reviewed the Jammed or Restricted Flight Controls Checklist which ends at Step 7 if controls are operating normally; allowing for continued flight; which they appeared to be. If however; the aircraft would later exhibit abnormal elevator forces; during speed and configuration changes required for approach / landing; a flaps 15 landing would be required. This would not be a prudent landing configuration at ZZZZ; with potential wet runway considerations. Given the above maintenance history; I decided the most prudent course of action was to discontinue flight by returning to ZZZ. I requested priority handling; landed flaps 15; approximately 10;000 lb. overweight at ZZZ; [Runway] XXL; 13;000+ ft. of runway; using max reverse to slow considerably before manual brake application - autobrakes not used.

We proceeded to go through normal spark plug cleaning procedures; and the following check displayed no roughness; and an RPM drop well within standards for departure. We elected to depart; headed for our destination of ZZZ1 via ZZZ VOR; to avoid the active restricted airspace. This route of flight unfortunately did not provide an overabundance of suitable diversion airports. Roughly 15 - 20 minutes into the flight; we began to hear a slight 'knocking' - best descriptor I could think of at the time - from the engine; every few minutes. We noticed the issue; and started with changing our mixture slightly to hopefully find a position the plane liked more. As we continued on our route of flight; the abnormality got slightly more frequent. At this point; we began more intense troubleshooting procedures aligned with checklists; and advised ATC of our new intention; which was to divert to ZZZ2; which had a Cirrus Service Center for maintenance on the ground. At this point; the abnormality was still fairly spread out; and not severe. ATC asked if we were requesting priority handling with the diversion. I advised them that; at that moment; there was nothing indicating that was necessary yet. Shortly thereafter; the abnormality became much more frequent; and more severe. At this time; I elected to turn around to ZZZ3 airport as the closest runway; and request priority handling with ATC as a precaution; in case the problem became worse to the point of failure or severe loss of power. ATC was extremely helpful in this situation; and operated exactly as intended in such a situation. I maintained altitude until over ZZZ3; and by the time we were over the airport; the abnormality was frequent enough that it seemed constant; and fairly severe. There; I circled over the runway to descend; staying slightly high on final and performing a slip maneuver to ensure glide range to the threshold at all times. We were able to taxi to parking under power. Upon shutting down the aircraft; I immediately called ZZZ Center as instructed to advise safe on the ground; with no injuries or assistance needed.

Aircraft was flown West of ZZZ to a range of approximately 10-14 miles for UHF checks; still at 5;500 feet MSL. At this location and approximately 30 minutes of flight time the throttle was moved toward idle. The engine RPM dropped suddenly; and the 'GEN OFF' 'ENG OIL WARNING' lights came on. There may have been more; but these were the main ones that caught my attention. The situation was diagnosed as a flame out and the 'Immediate Air Start' procedure was applied but no engine response was achieved. Given the RPM was above 18% the 'Wind Milling Start' procedure was applied with reference to the checklist with no engine response. Closer examination noted the HPC RPM at approximately 25% and EGT around 250 Degrees C. Airspeed was held at 180 KIAS. Given the RPM; 'Alternate Air-Start Wind Milling (Emergency Fuel Circuit)' procedure was performed with reference to the checklist. Engine response was achieved and the throttle was set at a mid- range with enough thrust for level flight until a 'key' could be achieved for a straight in to [Runway] XXR. Landing was on XXR with approximately 15 knots of tailwind. The throttle was not moved until landing was assured. The engine remained running until shutdown. The aircraft was able to taxi clear on 'S' under own power. [Priority handling was requested] with ZZZ tower right offer the first air start attempt was unsuccessful. transponder code was entered. Crash; fire; rescue followed the jet to the FBO. Authorities took a picture of the aircraft tail number and my Pilot Certificate. I was informed no other report with ZZZ was needed.",,,,"L39 Pilot reported a drop an engine flame out during cruise.

We were cleared for the approach and switched over to CTAF prior to IAF when field was in sight. We made appropriate non-towered radio calls communicating our position; distance and intentions. We heard 1 other call for traffic holding short 36 waiting for us to arrive; an aircraft of the same type as Aircraft Y. On short final around MDA approx. 400 feet I saw Aircraft Y making left traffic turning base and attempting to land. This was around XA00Z and dusk was setting in. At this time we had already placed our strobes; position and anti collision lights on as well as our landing lights. The traffic turning base in danger of hitting us was not making any radio calls and was not on ADS-B. I had to take controls from my student and aggressively dip below the path trajectory of the encroaching Aircraft Y to ensure safety. The aircraft holding short made radio calls to someone in the pattern telling them to turn their radio on and that they were cutting us off. We did a touch and go and departed the pattern to the north in the upwind. About 5 minutes later while still monitoring the CTAF we heard another aircraft having to go missed after another of the same type as Aircraft Y cut them off short final. That pilot advised them of the extreme danger that they were putting themselves and everyone else in risk of. That makes 2 close calls for aircraft on short final being cut off in less than 10 minutes! I am making this report because on Day 0 I was making another RNAV approach into CHN and a similar incident occurred where around dusk a same type aircraft not making radio calls and not on ADS-B cut me off on short final about 200 feet above TDZ and less than .5 miles away from the runway where I had to take evasive maneuvers and immediately go missed to avoid a sure mid air after the aircraft cut me off and dipped below my approach path. This almost seemed intentional both times. There is no possibly way these type aircraft do not see us on short final especially with the radio calls we are making. There appear to be at least 2-3 of these type aircraft in a group there maneuvering frequently. I hope there is something that can be looked into because in the past 2 trips I have been there in less than a week these type of aircraft have almost caused 3 mid airs!",,,,"Flight Instructor with student reported a NMAC that required evasive action to avoid collision with an aircraft at a non-towered airport.

The final air mission briefing sheet was given to me to review. The briefing included the following statement about our alternate -- 'Alternate Airports: X airports should be given first priority. Any other approved company alternate may require additional approval.' Our alternate airport was given as ZZZ1 airport. I called my Dispatcher and asked if ZZZ1 was approved as an alternate airport; per this statement above. Dispatcher looked up the same note and said they would check and get back with me whether ZZZ1 was approved and appropriate.  A few minutes later; Dispatcher called back and stated that system operations told her they did not know whether ZZZ1 had been pre-approved as an alternate for this flight. They could not find any documentation of that as the person that would have done it was gone and it would have been done earlier in the day.With this information; both the Dispatcher and myself agreed that it would be prudent to change the alternate airport to a military airfield. If we had to divert; there would be no way to get permission to land at ZZZ1. We jointly chose ZZZ2 as an appropriate alternate. We amended the flight plan and I added fuel to the airplane. A while later; I checked the ZZZ2 in Jeppesen. ZZZ2 has a curfew after XA:00 local time; after which the field is closed. I messaged my Dispatcher with that fact. After another few minutes; my Dispatcher called me on the phone again. This time; Dispatcher was noticeably upset. Dispatcher said someone from system operations had screamed at her that ZZZ1 was pre-approved and that she should have seen it before. Dispatcher was unable to continue her duties dispatching; so I told her to take a break and I would handle things from here on out. At that point; I called Chief Pilot and explained the situation. I was not convinced that ZZZ1 was approved as an alternate; nor that it was required to be pre-approved. No one had a concrete answer for me. The next day when we ultimately took the flight; our alternate was ZZZ2 and I accepted that flight plan with no questions.I don't normally inject my personal comments; however the behavior of personnel in system operations was unacceptable. The Dispatcher is a crew member. They cannot be intimidated and should be treated as any other part of the flight crew. Attitudes like that have no place in flight operations and I will not operate aircraft when any member of my crew is being harassed. I also will not tolerate 'pushing' the flight out when there is question on the legality of an alternate. Unless BOTH the Dispatcher and Pilot In-Command (PIC) agree on the decision being made; the flight should not operate.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain reported a communications breakdown between the flight crew and ground personnel regarding the selection of a suitable destination alternate airport.

I called for flaps 1; around 215 knots. We then received an amber caution (TE FLAP ASYM). I divided the cockpit duties; and the First Officer (FO) ran the QRH; while I flew with auto throttles INOP; and worked the radios. We did a long downwind pattern. ATC turned us inbound about 20 miles out. We tracked inbound to about a 10 mile final; and the turned outbound for another small downwind; base and final; in order to finalize everything. We had 1.4 hours of fuel; and requested priority handling. We landed with less then flaps 1; with slats extended; with a Vref of flaps 30 +40. The FO did a marvelous job of running the QRH; communicating well; and with good pacing. I had to focus more on flying the airplane - due to the ATS (Autothrottles) being INOP. After the FO had finished the QRH - to the deferred items - I transferred the plane and radios to him; so I could read the QRH and close the comm loop; and increase my situational awareness. We were landing at a high altitude airport; with a Vref that was flaps 5 maneuvering speed. We were landing with less then flaps 1; but QRH doesn't address moving the alternate flap switch to 20 degrees - to have your slats at full extension. I brought this up to my First Officer; as it wasn't sitting right with me. I thought we would be directed to move the alternate flap switch to 20 degrees; similar to the other flap malfunctions. The FO leaned toward just leaving it at flaps 1. We talked it through. We knew that the flap lever was locked out with the asymmetry; and that we had only selected the L.E. alternate flap switch. So only the slats would be energized to move. Also there was a chance that we were expected to move the slats to full extension (though the QRH didn't specifically mention it) - with this confusion; we both agreed that it was safer to try to fully extend the slats; while knowing that the flaps were de-energized and stuck. We leaned on the side of caution; and agreed that this was the safer course of action. We knew we were landing at a high altitude airport; high deck angle; and a low Vapp speed. We briefed the differences in landing; as well as a possible missed approach. On final our pitch attitude was around 7.5 degrees. The Captain did the landing; in the touchdown zone; with auto-brakes 3. We exited the runway at Taxiway 1. We taxied to the ramp; while monitoring the brake temperatures; and really never saw the temperatures rise. Overall I feel that we communicated well; and handled the situation. The high pitch attitude was a bit unnerving; and we knew the risks of a tail strike. The flare was 1-2 degrees; while keeping power in to assist; in not over flaring.",,,,"B757 Captain reported receiving a flap asymmetry caution when selecting flaps 1 while configuring for an approach.

Though reported winds didn't seem very strong; actual conditions were a different story. After takeoff the plane climbed surprisingly fast achieving pattern altitude prior to the crosswind turn. Departed that pattern from the crosswind climbing to 1500 ft. for the short flight to ZZZ. Found difficulty leveling the plane for cruise in the choppy air; reduced speed to compensate. The entire journey was shockingly bumpy. Had I had a passenger; I would've returned home. Not having a passenger I saw an opportunity for a crosswind landing. After checking weather I verified my assumption that ZZZ was landing on Runway X. Had the winds been on XX I would've gone home due to the trees on that end. I checked in with Advisory in accordance to the Special Flight Rules and continued my arrival. The air was quite turbulent over a lake causing numerous corrections to maintain level flight. Typical procedure at ZZZ for Runway X is to come in long; base to final; never entering an actual pattern; though today the flight school based there was quite active and I heard 3 planes in the pattern. I heard a 'go around' called; my assumption was because of wind and student pilots. I heard multiple position calls on the radio. Due to the traffic and conditions I thought it prudent to make a radio call; knowing all these planes most likely has CFI's onboard. I stated that I knew typical procedure was base to final but did they want to me to cut over and enter a pattern. The response I received was to go ahead with my approach. Following the railroad tracks would be the norm performing a long arcing base to short final. With the winds like they were I went a bit wide skirting the border of the Special Flight Rules space so I could achieve a cleaner straight final approach. As a low hour pilot I was very critical on my approach procedure setup and I remember mumbling my mantra 'settle for nothing.' Achieving a stabilized approach was very difficult. I was moments away from a go around; still too high when I achieved balance. My descent was stabilized and I was focused on target; on the number. I made a radio call; traffic; Aircraft X on final Runway X.' Crosswind correction; throttle; a little more speed for the wind.The numbers; crosswind correction; the numbers; correcting....I remember entering my flare and thinking what is that? Crosswind correction; touchdown.It's a helicopter! Crosswind correction; brakes; more brakes. I remember when I realized the helicopter wasn't moving. Just hovering about 4 or 5' off the runway about midfield. What is that sound I thought? It's the sound of the brakes locked up. The plane slid a bit left and right. Should I go into the grass? To make a dramatic story a bit shorter; I safely brought the plane to a stop on the runway short of the helicopter; which; of course; had no idea I was behind him. No damage to man or machine; though I probably gave the helo pilots a scare with my urgent radio call; 'Helicopter climb; helicopter climb; helicopter climb. Which he did after I was stopped. I exited the runway; completed my business and flew home. While in the building a CFI and his student reported they hit their heads on the ceiling of their plane due to turbulence. The turbulence and wind were very sporty. The real question is how did I not see a helicopter on the runway? That's a simple answer. I was too focused on the approach and did not see or cognitively acknowledge its presence on the runway. I'm sure workload was a significant factor. I know that I did not know a helicopter was in or near the pattern. I have no recollection visibly or audibly that there was a helicopter to consider. After speaking with a couple CFI's I'm told this is not uncommon. A new skill I need to urgently add to my bag. In hindsight I know a helicopter yields to a fixed wing; but at that moment the runway was his; though I didn't know he was there. In allof my limited experience I have never known a helo to be hovering over a runway. I've always seen them over a taxi way or grass. I've observed them flying down a runway; but never just hovering there while 4 planes are in the pattern. Does one do a low level go around over the top of a hovering helicopter? Surely that's not a thing. I will be perusing extensive training on the matter in an effort to understand more about helo procedures and what I should expect to see from them. I can tell you nothing in my PPL training prepared more for this event. I believe there is a lot to be learned from this event and I intend to learn it and share it with others.",,,,"C182 Pilot reported landing on a runway that was already occupied by a helicopter and the need to employ hard braking to avoid a collision.",

The student had prepared for the gust and crosswind correction as he had briefed he was going to use flaps 10; increased approach speed by 5 kts (1/2 the gust factor) and had the side slip landing correction in appropriately on final. In the round-out above the runway; a gust of wind blew the aircraft off of the centerline and the student called go around and added full power while applying back pressure on the stick. At the slow airspeed the aircraft didn't climb at full power and the high angle of attack; and as the wind blew the aircraft further from the runway; I called my controls and lowered the nose to pick up airspeed when we departed the runway hitting a taxi light and taking the right wheel pant off of the aircraft. I had established positive control of the aircraft climbing away when tower reported that we had lost a piece of the aircraft. We climbed; and flew a low approach so tower could inspect the aircraft. When flying over the runway we observed that the right wheel pant was on the ground near where we had the excursion. Tower reported that an observer had said that our right main gear was flat. We flew a right pattern after having requested the longer wider runway. We prepared to land left main; then nose wheel; expecting the right main to be flat. We briefed using left brake and rudder to compensate for the added drag of a flat right wheel. We executed the landing as briefed; and were happy to discover that our right main gear was unaffected. We taxied clear of the runway and taxied back to the hangar before securing the aircraft. We were able to taxi without any problem; verifying that both our brakes were working.The student; had many hours in the aircraft; which they owned; and had experience in winds similar or greater to what we were flying. The flight was a training flight as it had been 60 days since he last flew. This fact should have raised my guard more; and I was pulled into a false sense of security as the maneuvers he had performed earlier in the flight seemed to show he was still very proficient. I will guard the controls on final more carefully; irrespective of the amount of experience the student has.",,"Coming into land on Runway XXL the approach was stable and controlled despite the wind and gusts. Either upon touchdown or within 5 feet of ground strong gust push the plane to the right of the runway. Go around was initiated and there were two bounces one of which struck a runway light. The gusts made it difficult to take off again. It was very unexpected as the gust happened at a very inopportune time at touch down and pushed us aggressively to the right.Once elevation was gained we went around to have tower check gear and then landed without incident or any gusts. I'm not sure what could have prevented it; perhaps more aileron inputs into the wind to compensate for any gusts and perhaps a split second sooner go around at first inclination of gusts. As mentioned the timing of it was pretty much the worst ideal moment.",,"Flight Instructor on training flight with student reported runway excursion during landing/go-around event.",

During pre-flight; I was notified there was an incident with a Dangerous Goods. A passenger had a collapsible motor cart for moving through the airport and wanted to check it into the cargo pit while traveling on our flight. The ramp agents; following Air Carrier X procedure; tried to identify the battery type on the cart. The cart had no identifying markings or easy accessible battery to inspect. I was called to make a decision.I looked at the cart and agreed it wasn't identifiable. We asked the owner who said she had no documentation; but had bought the cart at Store X. She stated she flew many times on Air Carrier Y and never had an issue with them not boarding it. I conferred with [the] Chief Pilot in ZZZ2 by phone and described the situation. Our Dangerous Goods expert in HQ called me and asked if we could get more information or a way to identify the battery. I called local maintenance and asked could they help by loosening the four hex bolts on the power area which they did. We looked the cart up on Store X website and all it identified was that it was "Airline Approved." After opening the closed compartment; we followed the leads to a flat area and opened two more screws where a blue LI battery was located and had 'Hb Li-battery' identifier. Air Carrier X doesn't allow carts checked in cargo compartment with an attached LI battery. The battery must be unattached and carried in cabin only. Our maintenance was able to unhook the battery; secure the containers on the cart and tag the leads. We checked the cart in the cargo hold; and bagged the battery and carried it in cabin. Air Carrier X then notified ZZZ1 and ZZZ3; the final destination; to expect this cart and when it arrived in ZZZ3 to reinstall the battery. Air Carrier X coordinated with the flights and stations involved. I would like to flag this as a possible safety issue as Store X is selling these carts as airline approved; but no markings to allow airlines to comply with the procedures for Dangerous Goods. There is also no easy access to the battery to unattached. Since she stated she's flown many times with no issue or being questioned; seems to imply there were safety issues at the other flights with the cart being checked with a large LI battery in the cargo pit. Air Carrier X has had instances of batteries catching fire and if it is in the cargo it has potential to cause an accident or safety incident.",,,,"B777 Captain reported a passenger attempted to board wheelchair labeled as 'Airline Approved' by vendor.

The home base for the aircraft is ZZZ; so aircraft was towed back to hangar and the culprit to the engine out was quickly identified. A ground came loose and landed itself onto the Ignition Switch (where both Left and Right Ignitions attach) which caused both ignition systems to ground and in turn shutoff ignition to engine during flight. Approximately 2 weeks prior to this incident the radio (which sits above the ignition switch on the panel) was worked on and the shielding to the wire harness was rewired.

After he informed me; I asked the Operations Agent about them and if there was a dangerous goods from for this flight.  Operations Agent said there was not a dangerous goods from and that they were unaware of any issues with the cargo that was being loaded.  The FO and I started to look through the FOM HAZMAT section to try and find more information about battery transports. He said the label on the boxes was similar to the one on page XX.  These materials cannot be transported. I then called the Chief Pilot On Call for help. He looked into it and found that label marked are approved to be carried. I asked the FO if he remembered what number was on the label; but he was not able to specify since he didn't take a picture. I asked the Operations Agent again and they said they did not know how the boxes were labeled; but that they have been doing this for 35 years and never had a problem before with this cargo. I went to the Ramp Agent who was in charge and asked about the HAZMAT on board. He said there was not any HAZMAT on board. The problem was the cargo was piled behind 60 pieces of regular luggage; and they could not easily tell me what was on board. I had them move the bags so they could access the boxes. They found the label. These are approved for transport on Company aircraft and do not need a dangerous goods from.  Notes - Our 35 year tenured Operations Agent was less than helpful about what specifically was on board. Her attitude struck me as; 'We do this every day. Why is there a problem.' Even though the Operations Agent was the one who climbed into the aft cargo hold and found one of the boxes and took a picture of the label to show me. The Ramp Agent who loaded the boxes didn't know what a HAZMAT sticker is obviously.  There was not one piece of paper indicating the specifics of the items of cargo being loaded. And when I asked about all of this to our very senior Operations Agent; she responded with; 'Our station manager is worthless.' We finished the boarding process and left 20 minutes late.Suggestion - Even if a dangerous goods from is not required for specific HAZMAT; our Team Members should have available to them a detailed list of any cargo that has a HAZMAT sticker/label on it so we can verify that it is in fact approved for transport. Perhaps just a reference sheet. If not; our Pilots may find themselves concerned and unwilling to depart until the items are verified or removed.  Our HAZMAT section is also poorly written especially when it come to determining if what is on board is one of the approved items. I think this should get some attention from the lead Operation folks.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain reported a Lithium Ion Battery package was loaded without providing a NOTOC to the flight crew during preflight.

However; this night the weather was at mins; thunderstorms in the area and the probability of a go-around was high. To simultaneous broadcast on both Clearance Delivery and Tower frequencies is completely unsafe. It's very distracting to have a full re-route clearance broadcasted on Tower frequencies; while aircraft are conducting high workload; low visibility/low ceiling instrument approaches. If this is normal practice; which the Controller said; it was when queried on the taxi post landing. I find this to be unacceptable; especially with all the recent close calls seen on national news. Stop the simultaneous broadcasting on tower frequency during busy times. If the excuse is the lack of ATC manning; fix it. And here's an idea.

We were instructed to make 3 right turns and hold short of the runway. When [the Captain] set the parking brake; we confirmed the halon extinguisher was discharging into the flight deck. I left my seat and noticed the pressure gauge on the bottle had dropped down into the red and the bottle was cold to the touch. I unlatched it from its clasp and removed it from the flight deck. This was probably 5 minutes after the bottle failed. I placed it on a seat in first class noticing the pin and safety tie were still in place but the escaping halon; which was almost empty now; appeared to be coming from the neck of the bottle where a black rubber seal was visibly displaced outward which would normally not be visible. I returned to the flight deck and closed the flight deck door. We developed a plan to return to the gate not believing we needed any assistance.

I immediately turn left for traffic pattern and landed safely without a problem. The engine troubleshooting started immediately after safely landing with magneto check which was OK and engine oil temperature and pressure in the green arc. CHT during the short flight was at 1;400 Degrees F for #3 cylinder while the CHTs for all cylinders was 340-360 Degrees F. Carb Heat checked ok too. I took airplane back to my hangar and started for some more troubleshooting the following days. A pilot friend recommended me to run a static RPM which I did and noticed I was only getting 2200 RPM of the recommended 2250-2350 RPM per the airplane's TCDS (Type Certificate Data Sheet). A borescope process and compression checked of all cylinders followed afterwards and found cylinder #3 with its exhaust valve which appeared it had a hole on its face and its compression test was at 0/80 PSI.Removed this cylinder and found the exhaust valve with a hole through the base of the valve. I took several pictures before removing the exhaust valve and talked to Lycoming Technical Representative and supplied them with a broad information of my operation procedures and engine parameter operation information along with not less than 30 pictures of the burnt valve in place inside the cylinder. Once I removed the valve several pictures were sent out to Lycoming. I further stated to Lycoming Technical Rep that I never operate my engine LOP (Lean of Peak) but always ROP (Rich of Peak).I suspect that the failure of this valve with a burnt through hole was due to probably an incorrect mix of the alloying chemical elements (Chromium; nickel; manganese; silicon; vanadium; tungsten etc.) during its melting process along with an incorrect heat treatment afterwards of the finished valve; at the end of the manufacturing process; for annealing; tempering or stress relief and a deficient quality control of their manufacturing processes rather than an operator misuse.I am filing this safety report because it may be that potentially there could be some more valves like mine manufactured from the same batch and date out in the field installed in some other Lycoming engines. I have shown pictures of this failed valve to my AP mechanic and some other experienced AP mechanics and pilots and their opinions have been that they never seen anything this bad before in their lifetime profession.  My engine is a Lycoming O360-A4K; 180 HP whose failed cylinder/valve was installed new almost 6 years ago; which was bought new from a Lycoming distributor; installed by a certified AP mechanic and failed after only 183 hours in service which is supposed to last 2;000 hours!",,,,"Sundowner 23 pilot reported loss of engine RPM and engine roughness in the traffic pattern.

Person B opened the QRH to the appropriate checklist while Peron A disconnected the autopilot. The malfunction cleared and the autopilot was re-engaged. Knowing that Aircraft X had been rained on overnight; it was assumed that this was a sensor issue from the moisture. During troubleshooting; the malfunction occurred a couple of more times. As the aircraft was hand flown; it was noted that there was a slight roll drifting to the right. Person A even asked Person B if all of the passengers were on the right side of the aircraft; slightly in jest; but that was the sensation that was felt while flying by hand. One notch; and then two notches of left aileron trim input were given. The autopilot was re-engaged one final time and the same master caution appeared again (this was the only specific malfunction annunciator that ever illuminated from the initial incident through the completion of the flight). This time; while hand flying; Person A noticed that the rate of roll was increasing and more left aileron input was required to maintain level flight. Airspeed had not been changed. Per the QRH; the aircraft was going to continue to be hand flown while maintaining a speed below .78M. ATC was advised and the destination changed to ZZZ1. Person A began a left turn and descent while Person B ran checklists and coordinated with ATC. It should be noted that at no time were any of the flight controls frozen. While descending through approximately 16000-10000 ft; a noticeable bump was felt in the yoke as if something let loose or had disengaged. Control forces remained constant; however; with approximately 30 degree left yoke and 2 notches of left aileron trim. ZZZ Center originally cleared the aircraft to land on the North Runway XX while descending visually through approximately 7000-8000 ft. over the mountain range to the East of ZZZ1. Person A was not comfortable slowing the aircraft enough to fly a traffic pattern to XX since they were positioned slightly to the north of the airport. Person A did not want to fly at slower speeds and make more turns than necessary due to the unknown nature of the flight control malfunction. ZZZ1 Tower authorized a landing on any runway; thus; an approach and landing was made to XY. Weather conditions during the descent were VMC and ZZZ1 reported winds calm while on final approach. Note that during the descent; the spoilers were engaged between half and ¾ deployment with no change in required control inputs. A flaps 20 landing was utilized to prevent making unnecessary configuration changes at a lower altitude. It should also be noted that the control lock was in while the aircraft was on the ramp at ZZZ. The deflection of the ailerons was to the right while the control lock was in place. The landing was accomplished smoothly; however; it was overweight at approximately 20200 lbs. There were no injuries to the five passengers or pilots.

When Aircraft X entered the airspace; they were direct to ZZZ airport descending to 150. Inbound to ZZZ1 at the same time was Aircraft Y and Aircraft Z. Two of three runways at ZZZ1 were closed meaning all traffic at ZZZ1 was using the same runway; Runway XX. Aircraft A was doing survey work 8 miles south of ZZZ and 10 miles west of ZZZ1. First control instruction to Aircraft X was to issue a turn to heading 070; and a descent to 9 thousand. Aircraft X readback this instruction properly. Aircraft Z was well ahead of Aircraft X cleared for a visual approach to ZZZ1. Aircraft Y was being vectored for a visual approach based on needed spacing behind Aircraft Z. To ensure separation between Aircraft X and Aircraft Y; I turned Aircraft X back to the northeast on a 040 heading. I did not change his altitude assignment. At this point Aircraft X was around 115 still descending to 090. I attempted to issue a new heading for Aircraft Y and they did not respond to my instruction. I then realized I needed to cancel Aircraft Z's approach due to compression with a VFR Aircraft B ahead of Aircraft Z on final. The overall traffic situation was complex enough that I did not feel I had time to coordinate with ZZZ1 Controller for a plan between the Aircraft B and Aircraft Z; so I just turned out the aircraft of which I still had control. I attempted multiple times to reach Aircraft Y but they stopped responding to instructions. With Aircraft Y NORDO; I started issuing more instructions to Aircraft X; Aircraft Z; and Aircraft A to get them clear of the flight path of Aircraft Y in case Aircraft Y turned or descended. Aircraft A was a VFR survey aircraft working near the finals of both ZZZ and ZZZ1. All of my previous instructions had been based on avoiding Aircraft A while providing for a stabilized approach. My Supervisor was able to reach Aircraft Y on guard frequency XXX.X and I was able to resume communications with Aircraft Y. I vectored Aircraft Z away from Aircraft A and to follow Aircraft Y; who was now cleared for a visual at ZZZ1. I then turned Aircraft X back towards ZZZ and started to point out ZZZ to Aircraft X so as to clear Aircraft X for the visual. My Supervisor pointed out that Aircraft X had descended below the MVA. I am not sure at which point Aircraft X first descended below the assigned 090; but I had never issued a lower altitude. Admittedly I was more focused on the situation regarding Aircraft Y; Aircraft Z; and Aircraft A. I issued a low altitude alert to Aircraft X and climbed them back to 9 thousand. Lowest point on Aircraft X deviated altitude was 071 in an 082 MVA. The three aircraft that were attempting to land got visual approaches and landed without incident. Aircraft A was able to resume their operation shortly afterwards. A brasher warning for Aircraft X was issued. This was a conflagration of multiple small issues leading to me missing Aircraft X's mistake. The fact all traffic at ZZZ1 was using the same runway despite aircraft characteristics added complexity and risk. The wind condition necessitating that ZZZ was active a runway perpendicular to the active runway at ZZZ1 added complexity and risk. Aircraft A's aerial survey work near the finals for ZZZ and ZZZ1 added complexity and risk. That Aircraft Y responded to two radio transmissions and then stopped responding to instructions; adding complexity and risk. Finally that Aircraft X might misremember being assigned 7 thousand when I had assigned him a 070 heading; was the pilot error that caused the unsafe altitude. Ultimately this chain of events would be very unlikely to ever reoccur. If something similar did occur the only things I could do to improve my performance is an increased vigilance. I could have reissued the 9 thousand altitude at various times during this sequence. I chose not to do so as I did not want to risk Aircraft X mistakenly believing they could descend below9 thousand. The fact that they did ultimately make that mistake does not change my mind that constantly reissuing the same altitude just adds frequency congestion and increases the chance of misunderstanding.",,"ZZZ Approach gave us a descent into ZZZ and wanted us to do a box approach requiring several heading changes. I thought that I heard a descend to 7000 ft. so I set and was descending to that altitude. Approach did not question me about my altitude until I had leveled off at 7000. I had the airport in sight from a long way out and let Approach know that. After a heading assignment to the west it was evident that our altitude was too low for terrain a few miles in front of us which we had in sight the entire time. As I was about to call and question the altitude assigned; Approach called and asked me to climb to 9000 ft. which we complied with immediately. At no time were we in harm's way in terms of terrain or other traffic as we were visual and the airport was in sight. At their request I called and spoke to Person A at ZZZ TRACON after landing who was very pleasant and respectful. I'm not sure why I heard 7000. Possibly due to having the airport in sight and thinking that I would be cleared lower? Expectation bias? ZZZ did not seem busy. There was an Aircraft Y flight that had gone lost comms for a few minutes which likely also distracted the Controller.",,"Controller and Pilot reported descent below MVA which resulted in MSAW alert and CFIT incident.",

We were paralleling a line of heavy precipitation running on a line from northeast to southwest. The Controller asked if we could accept the visual approach just as we entered the clouds; so the visual was not an option. We were in a vertical speed descent around 700 FPM. Shortly after entering the clouds; we were given a turn and the speed very quickly went from approximately 210 kts. to 280 kts. over speeding the flaps. The speed brakes were immediately extended and thrust levers to idle to help control the over speed situation. The over speed lasted for a few seconds then quickly reversed to the point where the stick shaker was activated. The autopilot was disconnected to recover from the shaker. The bank angle warning also activated once during the recovery. The speed was going up and down quickly and the shaker activated three times. We were quite task saturated at this time. The speed brake was inadvertently left fully extended. We were on intercept heading to the localizer and maintained an easterly heading and climbed during the recovery. This led to a conflict with the traffic on approach to XXL. The turbulence and speed fluctuations were quite extreme. The Controller asked us if we were climbing and I responded we got into weather. After we cleared the turbulence area we engaged the autopilot and the Controller vectored us to the west at 3000 ft. Several other flights aborted their approaches shortly after our event.This was some of the most extreme speed fluctuations I have ever seen. I always try to avoid convective areas. The radar showed us paralleling a line of moderate rain. This whole event occurred southeast of any precipitation. The cloud we entered didn't have any precipitation or have a convective appearance to it. There was no lightning and the ride was fairly smooth until the airspeed climbed rapidly. In retrospect I would have given a wider margin to this weather system. The winds at 3000 ft. were around 60 kts. We were in contact with our Dispatcher inbound to the airport and thought the worst weather was West of our position. I would have also communicated our situation to the Approach Controller in a more timely manner.",,"The incident happened on base for Runway XXR when we were vectored into a storm cell about on a 7 mile final. Initially we were VFR on down wind to XXR expecting to turn short of the weather on a visual approach.  ATC was busy with the weather and other arriving aircraft and turned us a little later than we were expecting to base and we went into the clouds.  There was no turbulence prior to entering the clouds; and we stayed away from the red line of storms on the radar. I did not expect as rough of a ride as we received because the air was smooth prior to penetration and we were in front line of storms. As we entered the clouds we were at about 3300 ft. descending to 3000 at 210 kts. IAS; flaps 1.  In an instant we started to accelerate past 250 knots while hitting severe turbulence. I pulled the throttles to idle and deployed the speed brake fully while holding the throttles to idle and we continued to accelerate to 280 kts. and started to pitch over to maintain altitude. We asked for and immediately were given a turn towards final.  We were on a heading to join the localizer away from the weather when the stick shaker activated.  It happened 3 short times very quickly. We disengaged the autopilot and applied the throttles to max. I felt the Captain's hand push on the base of the throttles to ensure we were at max power. We received a bank angle warning shortly after disengaging the auto pilot because we were still in a bank on the turn to final approach course.  At this point we rolled wings level but started a climb because of the additional power and severe turbulence we were in.  The stick shaker started at 195 IAS; flaps 1 with speed brakes extended. We experienced increasing and decreasing performance quite quickly.  While trying to maintain aircraft control and our altitude; I went from full yoke forward to a level yoke on the overspeed; and idle thrust to max thrust a couple of time trying to maintain aircraft control and not over speed the flaps again. The turbulence was so severe it was difficult to see the instruments; while making communication inside and outside the aircraft difficult.  This was the most severe turbulence I have ever experienced. Due to the severe conditions we were in; the aircraft climbed to an altitude of around 4100 ft. during the recovery on a heading away from the weather towards the localizer. ATC queried us about the altitude gain and we should have told them about the severe weather we encountered; but we failed as we were trying to get the aircraft under control and back to 3000 ft. Once out of the weather we reengaged the autopilot started a descent back to 3000 and received vectors from ATC to land on Runway YYL. The two aircraft behind us experienced similar conditions; so a runway change was initiated. The Captain wrote up the overspeed. There was no overspeed annunciation; or wind shear annunciation on tail XXX. Mitigation.  Have a better plan. Don't fly into the thunderstorm. The short visual approach is fine unless you have to extend for any reason. Maintain required distance from storms; communicate as soon as possible so ATC is informed and can make good decisions pertaining to other traffic.  Recognize and initiate wind shear recovery procedures at an earlier point and notify ATC as soon as possible when deviating.",,"B767 flight crew reported extreme storm conditions during the final approach resulting in loss of control.

We were arriving at MIA via the VIICE2 arrival transitioning to the ILS 9. Weather was a scattered to broken deck with tops about 4;800 ft. MSL and bases about 3;800 ft. MSL. Visibility both above and below the clouds was excellent; 20 miles or more.Prior to arriving at the BILZZ intersection westbound we had been descended by ATC to 4;000 ft. MSL and slowed to 210 KIAS but were still following the STAR lateral track. At this point we were in and out of the clouds. About 4 miles west of (past) BILZZ we were cleared to descend to 3;000 ft. MSL and turn right heading 360 onto a base leg. We came out the bottom of the clouds into the clear about halfway around the turn. Just as we were rolling out northbound and passing 3;400 ft. MSL I observed a stationary object in the sky ahead; below; and off to our right. As we got closer it resolved into a quadcopter type drone. I estimated its altitude as roughly 200 feet below our altitude; so approximately 3;200 ft. MSL. I estimate the horizontal miss distance as less than 500 feet. I can't say how large or small the quadcopter was; but I can say I identified an orange glossy fuselage; and the 4 distinct black rotor booms. From my first sighting to us passing it was about 6 seconds. There was not time to take any evasive action; nor was any necessary.  But it is clear to me that had we been on a collision course with it; we would not have been able to see and avoid such a small target in the time available from first sighting to impact.Its position would have been on the order of 4 miles SW of the GRITT intersection. The Class B airspace in that area extends from 3;000 ft. MSL to 7;000 ft. MSL and we were well within the vertical and horizontal confines of the Class B. I immediately reported the drone sighting to the approach controller who promptly altered the vectors for the aircraft behind us to give the drone location more berth. We were then turned onto a dogleg and cleared for the ILS 9 approach. Shortly afterwards we changed to tower frequency and proceeded to an uneventful landing. I do not know what other actions the approach controller may have taken after I left his frequency.Cause - Some person(s) unknown operating a drone in Class B airspace. Or the machine had lost contact with it's controller and gone rogue on its own. Keeping drones away from controlled airspace is must-do. The 'how' is beyond my expertise.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported a near mid-air collision with a drone while on approach to MIA.",

They - 747 - were cleared to descend via in front of us approximately 10 miles ahead. The winds aloft were mostly a headwind around 30 - 40 kt. The flight was smooth across the Gulf of Mexico; seatbelt sign was off. During the descent we encountered a light turbulent airframe vibration lasting 15 - 30 seconds; followed by the yoke displacing 30+ degrees to the right; at which point the autopilot disconnected and we got an oral roll authority message. The First Officer observed the yoke movement; and took control as soon as the autopilot disconnected. The aircraft rolled slightly to the left. The First Officer took control of the aircraft and turned 10 to 15 left into the wind to escape the wake turbulence. I; the pilot monitoring; and Captain notified ATC of the wake turbulence and told them we would need to offset 1 to 2 miles behind the heavy. I immediately turned on the seatbelt sign and made a PA. I checked with the flight attendants after we were clear of the wake. No issues in the cabin were noted. During cruise we observed the heavy 747 contrail ahead of us; and I relayed a story of a previous wake turbulence encounter in light winds; so we had some anticipation of the wake effects and responded immediately and appropriately.",,,,"B737 NG Captain reported encountering wake turbulence while in the trail of a B747 during a descent.",

The descent and approach were briefed per normal procedure. The FO (First Officer) was the pilot flying; PF; Captain was pilot monitoring; PM; there was no Jumpseater or other flight deck crew members present. The pre-departure briefing included duties in case of abnormal operations or emergency - PF would continue to fly the aircraft and take the radios; PM would run any required checklists. Go-around procedures were briefed during the descent briefing. The approach was planned as a normal ZZZ ILS XXR in visual; gusty-wind conditions.At approximately XA:00 on Day 0; the flight was approaching ZZZZZ - ZZZ ILS XXR final approach fix - at approximately 1;800 ft. AGL. As briefed; the FO called for gear extension and setting Flaps 15. The gear extension sounded normal at first. However; both pilots observed abnormal landing gear position light indications. The following indications were noted: All three green landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. All three green landing gear indicator lights on the aft overhead panel were illuminated. All three red landing gear indicator lights on the instrument panel were illuminated. A single; unfamiliar; tone - beep - sounded briefly.Unsure of what may have caused the abnormal landing gear position indications and the unfamiliar tone - neither the PM nor the PF had heard this tone before - the PM suggested a go-around from the current altitude and the PF called for the go-around and started the procedures as briefed. ATC stated; "Aircraft X; go around; runway heading; climb and maintain 3;000 ft." The first "half" - i.e.; TOGA engagement; raising flaps to 15; which we were already positioned at; checking thrust; raising gear; [and] setting missed approach altitude - of the go-around was conducted normally. At this time; ATC started calling to ask about the reason for the go-around. This interrupted the go-around procedure. Approximately 30 seconds later as the aircraft was accelerating; the remaining procedures were accomplished - heading select; level change; setting clean maneuvering speed; raising flaps to 0; After-Takeoff Checklist. Allowing the ATC interruption and subsequent delay was pilot/crew error. However; the procedures were accomplished fully and safely.After go-around procedures were accomplished and the aircraft was overflying the ZZZ field; during the field overflight; the Tower reported that the aircraft's left main gear appeared to be extended while all other gear appeared retracted. All landing gear indicators on the flight deck appeared normal; i.e.; there were no red or green gear lights illuminated. The crew had no way to confirm whether or not the left main gear was extended. ATC queried the crew as to what airspace was required to resolve the issue. The PM requested vectors to remain in the local area and ATC vectored the flight west and directed a climb to 5;000 ft. MSL. The PF engaged the autopilot and maintained 230 KIAS via the MCP (Mode Control Panel) speed window.During the vector; the PF selected VNAV instead of continuing the LVL CHG climb. This caused the aircraft to start a brief descent while it attempted to recapture the cruise altitude in the FMC. The issue was identified by the PF; who disconnected the Autopilot and set the desired pitch attitude for the climb; followed by requesting re-engagement of LVL CHG; which was accomplished by the PM. The PF then re-engaged the Autopilot.The PM started to run NG Gear Disagree Checklist. The PF coordinated vectors with ATC and confirmed altitude and heading changes with the PM. While running the checklist; the PM: Step 1 - Landing gear lever is OFF. Step 2 - Landing gear lever moved to the UP position after takeoff; go-around. Step 3 - 235 KIAS maximum; landing gear lever: UP. Step 4 - All red and green landing gear indicator lights are extinguished. End of the checklist.PMthen determined that no additional resolution was available. We as a crew discussed if we should request priority handling; but it was decided that we had time and fuel 14;400 lb. left to continue to work on the problem. So we opted not to request priority handling at that time. However; ATC then asked us souls on board and fuel remaining; so we provided them with the information of SOB and 14;400 lb. of fuel remaining; or 144 minutes of flight time available. They essentially provided priority handling for us. Since we had no indication if our left main gear was still extended or not like the ZZZ Tower had told us it was; the crew then decided to contact a Company Ground Agency for any potential assistance or information they could provide. The PM contacted Company ZZZ Operations; who then directed us to contact Company ZZZ Maintenance. The Maintenance personnel suggested cycling the Manual Gear Extension Door located behind the FO on the floor open and closed as well as check for any popped circuit breakers. No additional resolution was gained as all landing gear indicator lights were still extinguished. While the PM was communicating with Maintenance; ATC contacted the PF and suggested the flight overfly ZZZ1 Airport; where Tower personnel could examine the gear positions with binoculars. The PF agreed and accepted vectors toward ZZZ1. When the PM was available; the PF briefed the PM on the plan to have ZZZ1 personnel visually inspect the gear. The PM agreed; then briefed the Purser; and made a short announcement to the passengers.Once the PM confirmed checklist usage complete; Maintenance agreed with the plan to overfly ZZZ1 and extend the gear. The PF accepted a descent to 2;000 ft. MSL and continued toward ZZZ1. Approaching ZZZ1; the PF extended the gear with PM concurrence. The aircraft was at 230 KIAS. The gear extension appeared normal; both in sound and landing gear light indicator illumination sequence. When complete; there were three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the instrument panel; three green landing gear indicator lights illuminated on the aft overhead panel; and zero red landing gear indicator lights illuminated. The aircraft overflew ZZZ1 at 2;000 ft. MSL and in a right turn toward the south. Through ZZZ Approach Control; ZZZ1 Tower personnel reported that all three landing gear appeared to be down. At this time Ground / Maintenance communications were called complete.With normal gear indications on the flight deck and visual confirmation from ZZZ1 Tower; the PF and PM decided that the gear would remain down for the remainder of the flight. At this point; the crew discussed and determined the following: All applicable checklists were run. Both flight crew members were comfortable moving into the approach / landing phase. The PF would continue to fly the aircraft. Call to Purser to rebrief the flight attendants on the situation and to NOT plan for an evacuation.The PF then requested and accepted vectors for the ZZZ ILS XXR. The PM reloaded the approach into the FMC and the PF called for the descent checklist. The localizer was intercepted between ZZZZZ1 and ZZZZZ. The remainder of the flight; including approach; landing; and taxi-in; were uneventful. During the approach; it was apparent that ATC; most likely Tower personnel; [provided us priority handling] and made Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) vehicles available. Additionally; on short final; ZZZ Tower personnel confirmed that all three gear appeared to be down. ARFF vehicles and equipment followed us to the gate area.After parking; shutting down the aircraft and conducting a short crew-only debrief - which focused on the go-around procedures and checklist usage - the flight crew was met by two ZZZ assistant chief pilots; Person A and Person B; and one Company Maintenance Representative. The flight crew was fully debriefed by Maintenance and [other] personnel. The PF entered an electronic logbook entry to document theevent.",,,,"B737 NG Captain reported the landing gear extension and indicator lights had problems and was observed to be acting abnormally upon landing gear extension. The flight crew performed a go-around to troubleshoot and a decision was made to divert to another airport to do a fly-by for Tower to confirm landing gear position. After the landing gear was confirmed to be down; the flight crew returned to the original airport and safely landed.",

We were VPATH captured with the visual [Runway] XX loaded in the box from straight. I assumed that would give us vertical guidance to final. As we were getting closer ATC called out the airport distance and direction. Based on what our VPATH was indicating I was looking too far out. ATC offered us vectors for descent - I assume because they knew we were high. We declined thinking we were set up well; planning on giving ourselves a direct to straight and flying the whole thing in automation.We finally saw the airport and realized we were high. We got cleared for the visual and ATC cleared us to maneuver in the airspace. I did not want to turn inside of the straight-in; so I decided to do a 270 left turn away from the airport to intercept the final approach outside of the straight-in for a more manageable descent angle / rate. I'm still in automation in heading mode at this point. The box had already sequenced to final. On our turn outbound; we get a TCAS RA at the same time ATC tells us there is a King Air maneuvering in that vicinity. I see the icon on the MFD (Multi-function Flight Display) and immediately make visual contact and kick off the autopilot. Given the fact that we were already Flaps 2 in a 25-degree bank and I could see we were turning in opposite directions and there was no danger of colliding with the King Air; I continued my descending turn following the command bars. However; since the box had already sequenced to final; it was telling us to go too low for that distance. We received an EGPWS for descent rate and then terrain. The terrain is relatively flat and neither one of us saw anything of concern. I leveled off and the warnings stopped so we continued the approach uneventfully. The whole event was 5 - 15 seconds long in my estimation.Suggestions - I should've put an altitude at the airport for descent planning. I should've accepted the vectors. I should've leveled off sooner.",,,,"CE-700 First Officer reported receiving a TCAS RA and an EGPWS alert while maneuvering for being high on the approach.",

Captain acknowledged the message and calmly stated for the student to complete a normal takeoff profile and we would address the messages on climb out - an excellent decision and use of CRM. Once safely established on climb out; Captain started the APU (experience showing here) and was in the process to address the R side generator messages via checklist but the system RESET itself and all R side messages disappeared. A few short minutes later; the L DRIVE and L GEN OFF illuminated. Captain indicated this was unusual and it was likely we may need to return to ZZZZ. We began the process coordinating a hold with ATC to allow for proper system evaluation and checklist use as well as coordination with Dispatch & Maintenance. Established in the hold; Captain used the checklist - the Left side electrical messages persisted and; as a result; the L IDG DRIVE was disconnected via checklist command. After coordination with Company; we were informed that Maintenance independently received IDG/ GEN related messages on BOTH the right side as well as the left side generator systems - though we only had left side indications persist. Again; Captain's instincts proved correct. Captain; in agreement with the Dispatcher and pilot flight crew; came to the universal decision the safest course of action was a return to ZZZZ for inspection. Next Captain coordinated with ATC to provide for fuel dumping and the fuel dump checklist was actioned and; later; the overweight landing checklist was actioned.

The relieved crew reported to us that the First Officer (FO) side VOR/ILS was MEL'd. They said that they had to conduct a missed approach earlier in the day at ZZZ due to a loss of all ILS indicators on both sides. The flight mechanic had run a test in ZZZ that the Captain side system passed. We prepared the aircraft for our first leg to ZZZZ1 and departed around XB55L. The Captain was Pilot Flying (PF) and First Officer (FO) PM. During the climb as we passed through FL310 we observed a steady decrease in the #1 engine EGT. This decrease continued down to zero before the display blanked out. A few seconds later; the EGT gauge began to fluctuate erratically; ranging between zero and 1250 degrees Celsius. All other engine indications remained normal. We leveled off at FL310 and executed the memory items for the engine limit; surge; or stall checklist. Even with the #1 thrust lever closed; the EGT indications continued to act erratically.We began to work through the QRH checklist and elected to halt prior to shutting the affected engine down. This was due to the problem most likely being an indication issue and our location over the ocean. At this point; the aircraft was in LNAV/VNAV without the autothrottle engaged. While attempting to troubleshoot the indication issue; the aircraft started to execute a left turn as per the active route in the FMS. This turn resulted in a rapid increase in bank to about 25 degrees; and a rapid loss in airspeed as the autopilot attempted to maintain altitude. We received a stick shaker activation. The PF disengaged the autopilot; and applied forward pressure and right aileron inputs. The aircraft was in a stable descent by FL300. The PF had the PM set a descent speed of 280 kts.We asked for an immediate return to ZZZZ; and [requested priority handling] with ZZZZ Center. We attempted to contact dispatch using XXX.X but could not get a response. As we got closer to ZZZZ; the PM set the aircraft up for the ILS Runway XX. We planned to do a flaps 15 landing and utilized the performance in flight section of the QRH to calculate landing distance due to the abnormal flaps condition and the overweight condition. As we were receiving vectors to the ILS; we overshot our initial intercept of the localizer to the left side of the Runway XX centerline. Initially; the localizer was alive on the Captain's side through the overshoot. We received a vector back to the localizer. At this time; we were in IMC. Once we received a re-intercept heading; we attempted to intercept and track the approach. At this point we lost ILS course and glide slope indications on the Captain's side. The PF attempted to follow the flight director and inadvertently descended a couple hundred feet below our ATC cleared altitude of 2500 ft. We were still a couple miles outside of the final approach fix. We broke out of IMC shortly after. I'm not sure of the altitude that we broke out at but it was between 2000 and 2300 ft. AGL. The aircraft was now located about 1 NM to the right of the Runway XX centerline. There was some confusion as to where exactly the airport was due to the erroneous indications of the flight director. The flight director continued to show a turn to the right. ATC queried about our position on the localizer and we requested a visual approach to Runway XX.

Once the first aircraft took off; the Tower cleared another heavy aircraft for takeoff. We voiced our concern to the Tower due to tailwind and faster approach speeds. The aircraft cleared for takeoff was slow on entering the runway and slow on takeoff roll. By that point; we were at 500 ft. and I was getting ready to execute a go-around. The heavy aircraft took off just in time for us to feel safe to land. The winds were [calm] on the runway. The aircraft encountered some residual turbulence from the heavy aircraft over the runway numbers. Around 50 ft. and reducing thrust to idle; just prior to flare; we encountered even more jet wash; wing tip turbulence that substantially rocked the aircraft wings. I was able to stabilize the aircraft; flare; and land safely.I am new to PHL. I experienced on multiple occasions and spoke to many other crew members who had the same experience with Approach vectoring too close; Tower clearing aircraft for takeoff and landing with extremely close or inadequate spacing. I personally had to execute S-turns on final. I was badgered into getting off the runway as fast as possible. It is unnecessary and could be potentially unsafe. A look into PHL airspace; arrivals and spacing to land; Tower operations; and requirements might be useful to uncover the primary cause of such tight; inadequate; or unnecessary risky vectoring; spacing; and clearances.

At the end of a 1.8 hour sortie; traffic pattern operations were being performed at ZZZ on Runway XXR. The conditions were turbulent but initially within student training limits. Multiple dust devils were visible within a few miles of the airfield. Winds began to change from light to a strong cross wind fairly quickly. When they finally shifted to 190/10G21; the tower elected to switch to Runway XY. This was when we decided to discontinue training. Due to the turbulent nature of the conditions; I as the instructor took control for the final approach and landing. When we turned base; the tower instructed us to land long. I accepted as this was a normal practice for us and the Runway was XXX0 feet long (much longer than needed to perform a normal landing). I elected to touchdown at approximately 3500 feet remaining as this is a normal Runway length for airfields at which we typically fly. After an uneventful touchdown; I began breaking normally and calling distances and speeds aloud for my student to understand I was paying attention to the rate at which I was slowing.  At approximately 800 feet remaining and between 25 and 30 knots; the aircraft immediately began pulling hard to the right. I made every effort to steer back to center line as well as slow the aircraft but was unable to until just off of the Runway. The aircraft came to rest approximately 10 feet from the edge aligned with the Runway. No airport property was damaged; the aircraft was completely intact including the tires and there were no injuries. After exiting the aircraft approximately 1 minute after the event; I noticed a wind sock showing winds from the northwest at greater than 15 knots.  It appeared there was a rapid change in the direction of the strong wind during landing roll. The aircraft was able to be towed away normally. Upon inspection of the aircraft approximately 18 hours later there was some brake fluid pooling under the left brake indicating possible issues with that brake but unknown if it was the result of the hard breaking or preexisting. There was no evidence of it prior to flight and the aircraft slowed normally from touchdown until the aircraft began to veer right.",,,,"Instructor Pilot reported a loss of control during landing.

None of the student's landings were even what I could call firm all day. His last landing was on center line with no lateral moment applied to the landing gear. His touch down was smooth and he gently let the nose gear come to rest on the runway. I said 'Nice!' and shortly after that (approximately a half second); I heard a loud bang and saw that the propeller had stopped spinning and that we were sliding down the runway in an unusually low nose attitude. After we came to a stop I assessed that we did not have a fire but elected to turn the fuel selector off. I made sure he was not injured and then radioed the FBO to close the runway. Once they confirmed that they were sending someone out the student continued to shut off the electronics and we egresses the aircraft. Upon exiting the aircraft I noticed that the nose landing gear was approximately 800 feet down the runway behind us. It appeared that it broke off near a weld on the support structure.

The aircraft filed and operated under an IFR flight plan; VMC conditions prevailed. Pre-flight inspections were normal; the aircraft was configured for a normal flaps 10 takeoff. The departure procedure was not new to either pilot as we operate out of ZZZ often. The clearance is almost always the same; turn to a heading and maintain 3;000 feet.Tower cleared us for takeoff and assigned a right turn to a heading of 240; maintain 3;000 feet. Takeoff was normal; gear retracted and flaps retracted on schedule. The Pilot Flying (PF) began to make the turn to heading 240 and climb was normal.As Pilot Not Flying (PNF); I began to perform the After Takeoff Checklist; briefly lowering my eyes from the instrument panel to do so.At about 1;500 feet and climbing; I noticed that the aircraft was in a sharp bank to the right (as directed by the command bars) and very shortly after the aircraft aural warning sounded 'Bank Angle..Bank Angle'(indicating 60 degrees of bank). I estimate that the aircraft was in an approximate 60 degree turn to the right and that the nose of the aircraft had dropped; briefly; which caused the aircraft to descend at a shallow rate. On seeing this I asked the PF if he 'had the aircraft' which he responded to in the affirmative. The PF was flying the aircraft by reference to the attitude indicator in which the aircraft indicator was within the command bars. The attitude indicator/command bars showed that the aircraft was on course and within the indicated command bars; albeit at a high pitch angle and high roll rate uncharacteristic of this phase of flight. The command bars then indicated a turn back to the left and again directed an abnormally high pitch angle of at least 20 degrees. As the aircraft turned back towards the commanded course the vertical speed increased substantially; partially due to the conversion of horizontal to vertical component of lift. The altitude limit of 3;000 feet was exceeded. The PF stopped flying via reference to the command bars; reverted to raw data and began to return the aircraft to its assigned altitude of 3;000 feet/heading 240 degrees. Before this was able to happen; approach control assigned a higher altitude and direct to a NAV fix.The time from takeoff to the time of the excursion was approximately 3 minutes. The time to recognize the deviation and respond appropriately took about 15 seconds (Human Factor - time to identify; interpret and respond). At all times during this incident; and until the PF reverted to raw data; the aircraft was flown within the command bars indicated on the attitude indicator.Approach control (XXX.XX ZZZ Departure) notified us of a possible pilot deviation and gave us a number to call on arrival at our destination.On arrival at our destination we discussed the incident; deviations made; and called the number assigned to speak with ZZZ TRACON. As a crew; we understand that deviations such as this are serious and must be identified in a very short period of time. We did identify a problem almost immediately; however; only after the altitude/heading excursion was made as we were within 1;500 feet of level off. ZZZ TRACON also stated that the aircraft had turned to the east from its assigned 240 degree heading. We have requested radar track to confirm this as it is important to know and compare to what we witnessed in the cockpit so that we are able to report this to both the aircraft and avionics manufacturers. During the entire incident; there were no Master Caution or CAS Indications. The only abnormal indication that presented was the uncharacteristic command bar indication and the TAWS AURAL Warning of 'Bank Angle...Bank Angle'.As a crew we are very concerned with what happened. We take full responsibility for the heading and altitude deviation. As a crew; we followed standard operating procedures which include the use of the attitude indicator;aircraft indicator and the command bars. The aircraft was flown completely within the limits indicated by the command bars. Had the autopilot been activated; we feel that things could have been much worse. While both of us as a crew followed the prompts of the command bars and there was a moment when the aircraft was flown outside of the indicated limits due to reverting to raw data only; we corrected and returned to the course assigned. If the autopilot had been engaged during this time and the command prompts presented as they were to the hand flying crew; structural damage would have been likely and a much worse situation may have unfolded.Previously; a similar incident on the same airframe type and same avionics package occurred which resulted in the loss of one life. The conditions that center around the core problems of that aircraft are remarkably similar to what we experienced as a crew on Day 0. Namely; the possibility of material introduced into the pitot static system. The previous incident included many Pilot errors including leaving a pitot tube cover on a probe resulting in an aborted takeoff. Though not mentioned in the NTSB Preliminary Report; there is a theory among pilots on professional pilot boards that this may have resulted in the introduction of melted plastic or other debris into the pitot static system which on a later flight caused an Air Data Computer malfunction and subsequent system failures or mis compares. On our flight on Day 0; we originated out of ZZZ2 and departed in very heavy rain. It is my opinion that there may have been water accumulation within the system though there were no CAS messages or other indications to confirm this and the aircraft operated normally until the departure from ZZZ. On arrival to our home base; our Director of Maintenance contacted the last service center that we were at (we had just taken delivery of the plane from maintenance several days prior - this was the first assigned flight since maintenance) as well as the Aircraft Manufacturer and Avionics Manufacturer. At this time; Technicians are en-route to evaluate our system; and the aircraft is grounded until firm evidence of the malfunction is presented and resolved.Both crew members intend to fully cooperate with any investigation of the excursion and would like to help find the cause of the erroneous information that contributed to the deviation while also continuing to improve skills that will prevent this type of deviation from happening again.Human factors - the time to identify; interpret and respond to what we saw played a part in the deviations made. The Challenger 300; lightly loaded; on a cool day at sea level has an initial climb rate ability that exceeds 5;000 FPM.Crew identification of an uncharacteristic commanded pitch and roll attitude also played a role. Identifying what is not normally seen in normal operations and reverting to raw data only; knowing when to remove automation and just fly the airplane. As a result of this incident; we are going to move performing the After Takeoff Checklist to an altitude of at least 5;000 feet AGL. At this point; as trained for the last XX years the standard call out on departure is gear up; flaps set (if greater than 10 degrees - indicate setting); flaps up; after takeoff checklist. This is often called for at X00 feet AGL as the flaps are retracted. This experience has shown that moving ones attention from takeoff and climb out to a checklist (however briefly) is unnecessary. Most operations observe a 'Sterile Cockpit' below 10;000 feet - In my opinion; this should apply to all activities including the after takeoff checklist. The items on that checklist are not necessary for the safe operation of the airplane and consist of mainly cleaning the aircraft up; verifying that the gear and flaps are retracted. Both gear and flaps can be called as a course of flow and later verified at a safer altitude when there is more time and altitude. We will investigate further and incorporate into our SOPs if this is determined to be a safer option. Given the incident at hand and the very short time it took to deviate; I believe that this one action will be beneficial. Crew experience - both crew members are seasoned pilots with a great amount of experience with the Challenger 300/350 airframe. The PF that day is a former Air Force Fighter Pilot; Airline Pilot and Corporate Aviation Manager with approximately X years and over X;000 hours of experience on this aircraft. I have personally flown this model of aircraft for XX years; approximately Y;000 hours over many different serial numbers; performing flight tests; entry into service; new aircraft delivery and instruction for pilots new to this airframe. In XX years of operating this aircraft domestically and internationally; I have never experienced what I saw on Day 0. I would like to have answers to what happened and will cooperate with any inquiry or investigation into this matter. I take full responsibility for the deviation of assigned altitude and heading. I would like to know what prompted the command bars to initiate action that contributed to the deviation made.At this time the aircraft manufacturer; avionics manufacturer and service center are working with us to identify any problems.",,"On Day 0 at XA:23; Aircraft X departed ZZZ en-route to ZZZ1. Pre-flight inspections were normal; the aircraft was configured for a normal flaps 10 takeoff. The departure procedure was not new to either Pilot as we operate out of ZZZ often.Tower cleared us for takeoff and assigned a right turn to a heading of 240; maintain 3;000 feet. Takeoff was normal; gear retracted and flaps retracted on schedule. As Pilot Flying (PF); at approximately 400 feet I began to make the right turn to heading 240 and climb to 3;000 feet referencing and following the flight director guidance. As the aircraft climbed through approximately 1;500 feet the aural warning 'Bank Angle' was announced and the flight director still indicated a command to turn right and climb at approximately 20 degrees nose high. My co-pilot alerted me of these conditions and at that point I realized that the flight director commands were not correct and transitioned back to raw data to fly the aircraft. As a result of incorrect flight director commands aircraft turned past 240 degrees and climbed to an altitude of approximately 4;400 feet at which point I began to correct back to the assigned heading and altitude. During this period approach control assigned a higher altitude and direct to a NAV fix and we complied with those instructions as directed.  The time from takeoff until the time of the excursion was approximately 3 minutes. The time to recognize the deviation and respond appropriately took about 15 seconds.

The aircraft experienced a very sudden onset of a left turning condition near simultaneously; pulling me off centerline and towards the left edge of the runway. I noticed the exit for the taxiway was close by so I added power and right rudder to attempt exiting Runway XX at taxiway. As soon as those inputs were applied; I determined they were not helping the situation; so I pulled power and came to a stop on Runway XX. The aircraft remained fully within the confines of Runway XX and did not strike any objects prior to coming to a stop. The Tower Controller asked if there was a reason I was now stopped on Runway XX. I informed them the aircraft appeared to have a flat tire on the left main landing gear and I was unable to safely move the aircraft from Runway XX. Tower asked if they could coordinate ground services on my behalf and I responded yes. At this point; I shut the aircraft down and using a handheld transmitter; I coordinated with Tower for my passenger to depart the aircraft and walk to the terminal via taxiway; crossing taxiway and into the parking area. Tower approved the request and informed me the FBO would be able to tow me off the runway shortly. While waiting for recovery; I inspected the left main tire and noticed the inner tube valve was missing from the wheel and had been sucked into the tire where it remained attached to the tube. Within an hour the FBO was able to put the left main landing gear on a dolly and tow the aircraft to parking where it was secured and follow-on repairs were coordinated. This occurred on the return leg of a cross country flight from ZZZ. Prior to departing ZZZ; I completed a normal pre-flight using the flow in the POH and verifying with the checklist. The left main tire had a known flat spot however no cords were visible during the pre-flight inspection. There was no history of air being added to the tire in several flights and it appeared no air needed to be added to either main tire or the nose tire during pre-flight. During the take-off roll at ZZZ; there were no indications any tire was not at the appropriate pressure. Human performance considerations: Visual inspection of tire pressure may not result in discovery of an underinflated tire; a tire pressure gauge is a simple and inexpensive device that can quickly be used during the pre-flight to determine if air pressure needs servicing prior to take-off.",,,,"C-172 pilot reported a loss of directional control during landing rollout due to a flat tire on landing.

We established communication them and were given a Squawk Code. When approximately 5 miles SE from ZZZ2; the engine made a noise; not loud; but it was noticeable. There was also vibration. It was obvious to me the engine could not continue to run in this condition. I contacted ZZZ1 approach and said I was having an engine problem and needed to land. They asked if I was [requesting priority handling] and I said I absolutely was.

A Visual Observer (VO) was used and the sUAS was being operated in near proximity to the field and players; however in all cases the area below the sUAS were constantly being checked to ensure no people were directly beneath the sUAS. This was done both visually by myself (the pilot) and visual observer; but also but continually orienting the camera (providing the live view to the pilot) straight down to check for people. During the course of play however; on several occasions people/players ran toward the area previously cleared; potentially passing directly under the sUAS. Once I realized this was occurring; I modified the flight paths to provide greater clearance from people and avoid repeat occurrences. A contributing factor is that by nature; it is not possible to gauge the distance of the sUAS visually as compared to objects on the ground and the best way to determine whether you are directly over people is to look straight down. Even still; the parallax of the camera can create the illusion of not being directly overhead when you are; and vice versa.The regulation on this matter that defines 'directly overhead' to include outstretched arms; etc. invites pilots to narrow the margin of the proximity to people with the mindset that even a single foot of clearance is good enough; and as you get comfortable with this interpretation; the risk increases. I believe the regulations need to broaden this definition to include an area around the person; eliminating the black or white nature of the rule. If you are flying over a large group of people close together it becomes much easier to say you are over at least one of them. That was not an issue here.",,,,"Part 107 UAS pilot reported while flying a photo shoot for a sports game there were several occasions when persons walked underneath the path of the UAS.",

The flight was uneventful until the final portion of our arrival and our hand off to ZZZ Center. We were told that there was severe weather approaching ZZZZZ. We could hear planes requesting deviations to the North of ZZZZZ. Center advised us of the weather near ZZZZZ and asked us to let them know if we needed to deviate. We devoted considerable time and scan to the developing weather and in the cockpit we thought we could stay on our route or perhaps even deviate South instead of North. However; about 20 miles from ZZZZZ Center directed us to turn North. The directed turns and deviations continued until I finally asked why we were being vectored. Center responded that everyone was going that way so he assumed I wanted to follow. The deviations continued to the North and East of ZZZ2 almost to ZZZ3. At that point Center said they thought there was a legal gap and we could make a hard right turn when we were ready back to ZZZ. Again; we did a comprehensive scan with our radar and agreed with Center; and we made the turn. About 15 miles into that turn it became obvious that the route was not wise. We were at 12000 MSL with TAT at 8C. We were not near the freezing level and had plenty of spacing on moderate weather returns. However; we began to experience a great deal of fire on the windscreen followed by at least 3 lightning strikes. We also entered an area of moderate rain and turbulence. The ride deteriorated greatly. I asked Center how everyone else reported the ride through here and learned that I was the first plane they had turned. I asked them not take anyone else on this route because it was not good. We descended into the traffic pattern at ZZZ and they were landing south which seemed odd. They had switched the airport around but the storm front was coming from the South with the best radar picture was to the North at that time. There were reports of rain and strong winds but no shear reports or active thunderstorm on the field. There were definite storms around the field but we worked with Approach to get vectored onto the ILS XXL. We began configuring and got to gear and flaps 25 to attempt to capture LOC and GS. Between 4000 MSL and 1000 MSL the winds were very strong; between 65 and 70 kts. from the southwest. This made the weather a rapidly changing situation. As the airplane attempted to capture the glide path and localizer; I noticed large deviations in the auto throttles and the airplane was above the path and not capturing the LOC. We heard other planes going around and saw a large cell rapidly approaching the final. We decided to break the approach off but both agreed we now needed an immediate 90 to 120 degree turn to the E/NE to avoid the weather that had moved in. I called for the approach to be terminated; we were still 2500 ft. in the air but configured. I did not say go around; but did call for flaps 20; and once we got positive rate gear up. I simultaneously disconnected the autopilot so I could max perform the left turn and we experienced some very rough air. I don't know if it was updrafts and downdrafts but it was very violent. We also experienced massive airspeed changes and it was all I could do fighting the auto-throttles to not overspeed anything. I did not notice until we leveled that I had never asked for clean maneuvering to be selected. The storm/front charged through ZZZ and [we] were vectored for a bit. ZZZ decided to switch the airport and told all of us in the pattern we were going to be vectored to YYL. We had plenty of time to reconfigure and review the approach. We had a good look at the radar from a long final and briefed internally that if we went around we would escape just like the last time with a hard right turn away from the weather. Planes began to land on YYL. We were offered YYR and accepted. Again;no reported wind shear and planes were departing and arriving. We configured and joined the ILS YYR. We were visual and stable at 1000 ft. At 500 ft. I felt the power came way back and we went above the glide slope. I knew we had encountered a gain as simultaneously we got a wind shear caution. We were at 500 ft. so I elected to go around. I called go around; flap 20 and then positive rate gear up. Then it all fell apart. We again encountered either wind shear or just severe up and down drafts. Violent aircraft shaking and rapid auto throttle movement. Our throttles moved almost stop to stop and we got a low speed message at one point while I again disconnected the autopilot so we could execute a rapid 90 degree right turn. We eventually leveled cleaned back up and begin getting vectors. We did report the gain/loss etc. to ATC. We never verified GA illuminated and in hindsight I do not know if I actually got the plane into GA mode. After being vectored around; we were offered the ILS YYL. Planes were again departing and arriving. The last approach was almost identical to the first in that a cell overtook us on final. While approaching the glide slope it became apparent an area of heavy virga was ahead. Much credit to the First Officer (FO); I was focused on getting established on final when he made the case we must discontinue. They said we must break this approach off and you need to turn hard left. Once I looked out I quickly verified what they were seeing. Once again I disconnected the autopilot to effect a harder tighter turn. We experienced many of the same things as we did on approach 1. We began a set of very long vectors and had time to talk with dispatch and ATC. Dispatch changed my alternate to ZZZ4. I told them we had been hit by lightning and I would rather go to ZZZ5 knowing we have maintenance there. They denied this and said ZZZ4. We set a bingo and everyone agreed the worst of the storms were almost through. We reached our bingo fuel and diverted to ZZZ4 without further incident. I learned a lot and think I made several mistakes and wish I had done several things better and different. After seeing the radar feed after the flight it makes sense why we kept getting into the frontal boundary when I was able to see how it was moving across the field. I feel like I got so focused on the weather that I made it my immediate threat which made me not follow procedure correctly on all three go -arounds. Missed [approach] 1 - even though I broke the approach off and disconnected the autopilot to effect a better turn; I needed to execute the missed correctly. I did not methodically step through the steps; especially the key step of bugging clean maneuvering speed at 1000 ft. which would have been immediately. I did not disconnect the auto-throttles which may have been prudent. Since I didn't activate go around the auto-throttles were fighting not only the environment but I still had approach speed bugged. I was so focused on the weather escape I did not execute a discontinued approach correctly. Missed [approach] 2 I believe I reacted quickly and appropriately to the gain. However; once again was focused more on the escape turn than the proper go around. More so; looking back I think it is possible we had Microburst encounter. I was so focused on turning away from the storm that I completely failed to recognize what I believe happened; we went from a gain shear to a massive loss shear. I am embarrassed to say that I lost situational awareness. We should have transitioned quickly and definitively into a wind shear escape maneuver and I did not. Even worse; I chased auto-throttles for speed and once again never got clean maneuvering locked in. It is a good thing we had altitude and a partially clean airplane. Missed [approach] 3 If not for the FO I think I would have possibly flown us right into another massive wind-shift. That discontinued approach was better; but still a bit discombobulated due to the needed hard turn awayfrom the weather. I lost my situational awareness and was overwhelmed by the rapidly changing encounters. I got flustered and the conditions almost exceeded my abilities. I wish I would have executed the missed procedures as advertised and verified. I think I should have converted to a wind shear recovery on missed #2. I wish I would have queried ATC stronger before the turn into the area we got struck by lightning. I would not have turned there if I knew I was the first plane to turn. Last; the long vectors were nice but they are actually too much of a workload. I slowed way down to build time; but a holding pattern that the airplane could just fly why I thought and planned would have been invaluable. I do wish someone in Dispatch or ATC would have just had all of us go hold while the line made it through. However; I think we may have been the only divert that night. In the end; I just think somehow we found the wrong place to be on each approach. The First Officer was outstanding with his inputs and support. That would have been overwhelming without help from the right seat.",,,,"B767 pilot reported extreme storm conditions during arrival and final approach caused loss of control and significant airspeed deviations.

Oil Temp was ~160 degrees during engine start. Run up was normal. RPM drop was within limits; oil pressure within limits; everything else was also normal. Taxi and takeoff were normal with the student pilot flying. We proceeded on the local crossing departure with autopilot engaged. South of ZZZ1 we started climbing from 2;500 feet to 4;500 feet. We stopped the climb at 2;900 feet to clear the Bravo Shelf; and then resumed climb with full power; with the fuel pump on; mixture top of green. During the climb; the student pointed out the oil pressure indicator was below 50 psi and in the yellow; then CAS annunciated about the oil pressure. We continued to monitor the oil pressure. The oil pressure started dropping again we leveled off at 4;400 feet and immediately started looking for an alternate airport. Oil Pressure was decreasing every second. Initially we pickedZZZ2; however we determined ZZZ was closer and turned direct that way. CFI made a call on the practice area and then switched to ZZZ frequency. Meanwhile; we started descending to 2;500 feet at ~600 feet FPM. It appeared to us that the descent slowed at ~3;100 feet without any input by the crew. At that point the Instructor took controls; with oil pressure in the single digits. The CFI made one call to ZZZ CTAF indicating we were enroute with low oil pressure and would be taking any runway. We continued with the descent with low power setting and the RPM went to 2800+; oil temperature went to 200+; oil pressure ~2 psi and red CAS message annunciation. We talked about CAPS but determined we were too low. At that point around ~600 feet AGL we experienced severe engine roughness and heavy vibrations. The airport was not in sight and we knew we would not make the airport. The student pointed out a field with three dirt roads on it. First road we were lined up for had power lines so we side stepped to a road on the right; which had a vehicle on it. We side stepped again and configured the aircraft for landing. The student called out the airspeeds and the CFI landed on the road at normal approach speed; avoiding any obstacles. The engine quit and propeller stopped spinning on the landing rollout. We stopped the aircraft and the student secured the aircraft with throttle idle; mixture cutoff; fuel pump off and fuel selector to off. Student set the parking brake; we determined the aircraft was secure and we exited. After exiting; we observed oil all over the bottom of the fuselage; also leaking through the engine cowling and within the engine compartment.

I informed the Maintenance Operations Manager of the issue and said that we have the option to maintenance ferry the aircraft to another maintenance facility or we could apply MEL 35-XX-XX and block off the affected seats that had failed the test of the oxygen system. The Maintenance Operations Manager said that they wanted them to continue to follow the fault isolation procedures and see if we could repair the system. I continued to work with the mechanics via phone during the duration of my shift and then turned it over to the night shift. The next morning I arrived at work and asked what the status of the troubleshooting was and was told they had isolated the fault.

It was windy and raining moderately at ZZZ as we approached departure time with a line of thunderstorms west moving east-northeast showing lightning on the horizon. It was still quite dark at XA:40 when we closed the door to do the cockpit prep and pre-flight checklist.I had performed the walk around except for loading our crew bags in the baggage bin. I told my Co-pilot to load those up and get into the airplane and work on a clearance by phone while I moved and parked the rental car from which we had just unloaded our crew bags.As I walked back to the airplane I glanced at the baggage door just to make sure it had been closed. This was done from probably about 25-30 feet; essentially looking for a 'black hole' to indicate the door was not closed.We taxied out to Runway XX and received an initial departure clearance for a turn to 050 and an initial altitude of 3;000 feet. There was moderate rain and the wind was gusting from the west-southwest to west as the line of thunderstorms was getting closer.Takeoff was uneventful; with no indication of any doors not being closed. I had delayed rotation slightly because of possible wind shear from gusts from the thunderstorms. We were lightweight and with cool temperatures the aircraft accelerated quite rapidly. At approximately 300 feet to 400 feet AGL; just as we were entering the overcast; we encountered a brief period of moderate turbulence. It was at that time the 'Door Open' Master Caution Light illuminated and showing an 'ACC' (Accessory) Location Light which meant the baggage door was not seated properly. There was no noticeable vibration or unusual sound associated with the caution light coming on. I reduced power to preclude an acceleration to normal 250 KIAS and climbed at about 210 KIAS which was the approximate speed when the door opened. Due to the deteriorating weather conditions at ZZZ with low ceilings; rain; and gusty/strong winds and with no flight control issues I decided a return to ZZZ was not a good choice and elected to proceed to ZZZ1 at lower than normal speeds. After maybe 30 seconds or so with the Warning Light on I heard a loud bang and commented to the Copilot that I hoped that wasn't the door departing the aircraft. We continued on to ZZZ1 and landed without further incident. I did not declare an emergency as there were no issues with aircraft handling or proper power. Upon shutting down at ZZZ1; the Copilot went immediately to check the door and reported it had departed the aircraft along with a canvas style flight bag of his. We secured the aircraft and asked the FBO to place the aircraft in a hangar to preclude precipitation from entering the baggage compartment. In the aftermath; I contacted the Aircraft Owner and the Airport Manager at ZZZ. I asked the Manager if anyone had reported an object falling and asked him to contact the police department to find if there were any such reports. None had been made and I left my name and phone number in the event anything was reported. I then called the ZZZ FSDO to report the incident; and took photos of the areas of damage.I believe the door was closed by the First Officer (FO) with the leading edge hanging strap wedged between the door and the door frame. This allows the latch to close and will appear closed and latched from the exterior; but the latch will not be secure because it has not engaged the post to hold it shut. The turbulence likely exacerbated the opening enough for the door to open itself into the slipstream and it separated from the aircraft. I have done the same thing ... it's quite easy and very common. But I always visually check the edges of the door with adjacent fuselage to ensure full closure. In the dark and in the rain; I believe the First Officer missed the problem and I did not physically check it myself.I could have re accomplished the door closing but it's not realistic to have a two pilot crew and rely on the Captain to physically re-check every action by the co-pilot. I've had the strap get caught and the latch appears to be closed but isn't actually latched. I believe there could be a bungee cord attached to the baggage door straps that would not allow the straps to remain between the baggage door frame and the fuselage.",,,,"Captain reported baggage compartment door was not secured correctly and departed the aircraft in flight.

The aircraft was on final with gear down; no flaps and airspeed 15 kts. above normal approach speed; 135 to 140 KIAS. On short final the PIC reduced our airspeed to 115 KIAS; which is the procedure outlined in the POH; and maintained that airspeed until main gear touchdown. The landing was really good; on speed; on center line and the flare was correctly accomplished with no float and excessive sink. The landing was normal and the nose gear was gently lowered to the runway. It's when the nose gear contacted the runway and the power levers were positioned to ground idle when we encountered the problem. We started to feel a shimmy in the aircraft; nose up elevator pressure was applied to see if it was a nose wheel shimmy or not. The shimmy continued and then we had a partial collapse on the left side. I thought the left main tire had blown and the aircraft started to veer to the left. The flying pilot stated that the aircraft was going left and they could not get it back to the right. At that time he had both engines in full reverse; full right rudder and was applying the brake on the right side. I reached up and took the left engine out of reverse and placed it in the ground idle mode. That seemed to stop the left veer and we were paralleling the edge of the runway; this was indicated by the skid marks. At this point both engine condition levers were in take-off; climb and landing position which is 100% N1. Since the PIC was struggling with the aircraft; and we were very close to the edge of the runway; I positioned the engine condition levers to start and taxi; or 65% N1. The aircraft then veered to the left with the left propeller striking a runway edge light. After the left main gear was in the grass the aircraft started to straighten a bit but by this time the entire aircraft veered into the grass and the right propeller then struck another runway edge light. We came to a stop about 15 ft. from the edge of the runway; I immediately positioned the condition levers to emergency cut-off. The flying pilot secured the aircraft and I exited through the main cabin door to inspect for leaking fuel or a possible fire. None was noted. The first thing I noticed was the left main tire had not blown but the landing gear assembly had partially collapsed. The PIC then exited the aircraft; we made sure that we were both ok; and we both looked around the aircraft for possible fire issues; again none were noted. (Crash Fire Rescue) CFR then showed up and positioned the fire truck for a possible fire. The aircraft did start to leak a small amount of fuel from the left wing vent; I believe this was due to the left wing low position of the aircraft; we had around 2000 lbs of fuel onboard. A bucket was placed under the vent to collect the dripping fuel. Upon inspection of the left main gear assembly it was noted that the left main gear trunnion had broken. A local Mechanic pointed out an Airworthiness Bulletin indicating the identical break in the main landing gear trunnion. We called the appropriate agencies to report the incident; made sure the aircraft was secured and a plan was in place to get the aircraft moved from the side of the runway. The PIC and instructor then debriefed the incident and covering what went well; what did not go well and what we could do better in the future. There were no injuries and the only damage to the aircraft was that both propellers had a strike to the edge lights and the left gear area was damaged.",,,,"Cessna 441 Pilot reported a left main landing gear failure on landing.

Coming from the overnight in ZZZ; we were both selected for Known Crew Member (KCM) random screening. We arrived at the airplane and I felt busy; but not rushed. We had an MEL related to a fire loop/fire protection. I did the walk around and when I came back to the cockpit; it appeared as though we were done boarding already. When I reached the fire/overheat test of my pre-flight flow; something did not look right. I only saw one side passing the fire test. I then got confused; but remembered the MEL. I re-tested each; and grabbed the Captain's attention. I asked does this look right with our MEL? As I pressed each fire test. He responded that yes it was correct. Upon reaching cruise; the Captain noticed that 3 circuit breakers were popped on the overhead. They were the fire protection l engine 1 and 2 and the fire detection alternate power l. None were collared. We both became confused as to the write up. We looked at the MEL; it was the right side that was written up. I honestly do not remember exactly what I saw during the pre-flight fire/overheat test; I think I only saw the right fire message; not the left. I assumed that the left side was the MEL; as I only saw the right associated message. Upon further de-brief; the Captain was doing his T/O configuration check at the exact moment that I grabbed his attention and I did the second set of fire protection tests. He assumed I was asking about his T/O configuration test; not my fire protection test. There were extra messages at the time; I knew they were related to his test; and I think that added to my confusion. Bottom line - I think that we flew a leg without any functioning fire detection on the left motor. We made a maintenance write up about the circuit breakers.A contributing factor is the way in which our maintenance write ups are written. It is almost as if they are made to be confusing on purpose; leaving us to hunt for Easter Eggs with every MEL. Both the left and right engine fire loops are mentioned. Yes; I get it. As long as you have one functioning loop on each engine then you are good. Still; I see both the left and right mentioned. Simplify the language for each MEL; and the maintenance release altogether. It is just like the NOTAMs can be sometimes. It is as if we are set up to fail; we have to hunt for Easter Eggs every day; every leg; day in; day out. It is a never ending barrage of possible gotchas. This release alone had 26 pages of maintenance information. 26.",,,,"First Officer reported lack of compliance with MEL procedures allowed the aircraft to operate in revenue service with non-operational fire protection.

Leveled the aircraft off just above 27;000 ft. Did global assessment of the instruments. ECAM read; engine; vibration; high. First step says throttle idle. As we were confirming the number one throttle; the ECAM changed to engine shut down. Numerous distractions at this point; including ATC calling and calls from the flight attendants. Got radar vectors back toward the field and a descent to 20;000 ft. Ran the procedure. Elected not to attempt a restart even though we had windmilling RPM; good oil quantity; no vibration and a very low EGT. ECAM actions complete. Ran the QRH engine shut down checklist. I proceeded to the non-routine landing considerations while the FO set up for the VOR Runway XXL at ZZZZ. Coordinated with ATC to have Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) standing by. Briefed the flight attendants on the passengers that we would be returning to ZZZZ; and the safety vehicles would follow us to the gate. Briefed and flew the XXL at ZZZZ. Briefed that we would be slightly overweight at landing and I would monitor my decent rate a touchdown. We landed approximately 2;500 pounds overweight. Normal landing; rolled to the end of the runway; where we were met by ARFF. Made a PA to reassure the passengers and taxi to the gate.The mechanical failure of the engine was the root cause of the situation. There was a startle factor. Also; some confusion was caused by the ECAM changing midstream. Distractions included ATC and the flight attendants. Some of the calls and chimes from the aft of the aircraft I believe were accidental. It was the First Officer's second trip after IOE.

FO (First Officer) and I reviewed the flight manual; Dry Ice Dispatch Increased Carriage Limitations; the Dry Ice Supplemental Procedures; and the Drager PAC 7000 CO2 Monitor Alerts as listed in the Supplemental Procedures in the QRH.  All was normal until just prior to block out with the APU running and the doors shut; we had 2 minor maintenance issues that delayed our block out.  While addressing the maintenance issues; the Drager monitors began to signal increased CO2 levels.  We elected to reopen the doors since maintenance had to come aboard to address the maintenance issues; and since the FO commented that he was beginning to feel mild effects of the increased CO2 levels.  One Drager monitor (FO) increased to .8; the other Drager monitor (Capt) remained at 0; and did not go off.  We had positioned the third monitor in the jumpseat area and it also began to alert.  Opening the doors with the APU air and packs still on alleviated the increased CO2 levels; the Drager monitors all indicated 0; the FO commented that he again felt fine with no effects of the prior increased CO2 levels; the maintenance issues were resolved; and we discussed next steps.  The Dry Ice Supplemental Procedures in the QRH discuss the option to use Air System Manual - Air Conditioning Manual operation after each engine start to minimize the time with no or low airflow on the airplane; discusses the option for a Packs ON takeoff to maximize ventilation; etc.; but indicates in the verbiage that 'Packs OFF should not present a problem.'  We were aware of the options; discussed mitigation strategies; and came up with a plan should the Drager monitors indicate increased CO2 levels after blockout.  We assumed that the time to start the engines; and the time from takeoff to the packs coming pack on after takeoff would be so minimal; that we would not need to do a Packs ON takeoff or use Air conditioning Manual procedures during engine start; especially with the QRH statement that 'Packs OFF should not present a problem.'   We pushed back; started normally; some of the Drager monitors again began to indicate increased CO2 levels of about .5; one still indicated 0.  When the engines were started and the packs came back on; the Drager monitors again quickly went to 0.  We felt no ill effects; discussed our plan; again consulted the QRH supplemental procedures; and elected to continue.  After takeoff during climb out; the Drager monitors again began indicating low levels of CO2 at approximately .5; but they quickly went back to 0 and stopped indicating increased CO2 concentrations soon after the packs came back on.Over reliance on QRH Supplemental Procedures that should probably be slightly more conservatively written so as to not give the impression that 'Packs OFF should not present a problem.' and should RECOMMEND the use of Air Conditioning - Manual during engine start and a PACKS - ON takeoff.Suggestions: Small changes to the QRH Dry Ice Supplemental Procedures eliminating the 'Packs OFF should not present a problem.' statement and not only presenting the option; but RECOMMENDING Air Conditioning Manual Operation during engine start AND a PACKS - ON takeoff.  Both would mitigate the presence of increased CO2 levels; decrease distractions; and streamline our procedures and define a specific path when presented with the increased Dry Ice levels leading to the use of Dry Ice Supplemental Procedures.  In hind sight; if I were presented with this situation again; I would have preferred to use both Air Conditioning Manual Operation during engine start AND a PACKS - ON takeoff; and if the QRH procedure had RECOMMENDED both and not suggested that 'Packs OFF should not present a problem'; I would have chosen that path.  This change would minimize delays; eliminate distractions; and make our Dry Ice Supplemental Procedures safer.",,"I was the First Officer on Aircraft X.  During preflight; we were advised that our flight would be operated under supplemental Dry Ice procedures. The Captain and I reviewed the FOM; Dry Ice Dispatch Increased Carriage Limitations; the Dry Ice Supplemental Procedures; and the Drager CO2 Monitor Alerts as listed in the Supplemental Procedures in the QRH.  During our initial block out attempt; we closed all the doors; conducted a few remaining briefing items and completed the before start checklist; all with AC Packs on from APU air.  Once we selected ignition on; the air controller shut off the air to the packs; but it was at this point that we started working another maintenance issue. I was surprised about the onset of the CO2 monitors indicating elevated levels in the cockpit.  Shortly after when the air was shut off; my monitor starting beeping (at first I thought I had just breathed on it) and soon after the monitor we had placed in the jumpseat area started beeping (no jumpseaters however).  The levels on my monitor climbed to around .8 pretty quickly.  While we were trying to get the air back on and working the other maintenance issue it was at that point that I started to feel minor effects of the increased CO2 levels in the cockpit; and the third C02 monitor (Captains) started going off.  I estimate that this all took place within about 3 minutes of the air turning off.  Furthermore; it took a couple minutes of airflow to lower the CO2 levels.  Once air was reintroduced to the cockpit I started feeling better quickly. Of note; during this sequence the aircraft had not moved.  The Captain and I disarmed the doors to work the maintenance issue and ran the APU air to continue providing air flow.  The Captain and I discussed my health and continuing; which at this point I was not feeling any ill effects so we elected to continue.  Upon second block out; we expedited the time with the air off for engine start and even still got some C02 increased level alerts on two devices.  Again; whenever airflow was cutoff; shortly after the C02 monitors started indicating elevated levels. We did not move the aircraft at any point while the CO2 monitors were at all indicating elevated levels. After takeoff; we got again got an indication of elevated levels in the jumpseat compartment until the packs turned back on.  Finally; when we parked at spot X in ZZZ1; we had to wait about 20 minutes for a stair crew to arrive.  Per the Captain and I's plan; we started the APU on landing and had no disruption in airflow once we parked and shut down.  However; after about 15 minutes following shutdown while we were waiting for a stair crew; WITH all packs operating from APU air; we started getting increased CO2 level indications from two monitors.  Thankfully at this point the stair crew had arrived and was starting to position the stairs so we elected to wait it out. Cause: increased CO2 levels in the aircraft from carrying over 3000 lbs of dry ice.  This was exacerbated by a period of about 20 minutes that the aircraft doors were closed and all packs were operated under APU air before block-out.Suggestions: I've operated under Supplemental Dry Ice procedures before but this is the first time that the monitors have indicated elevated CO2 levels and that I've felt the effects.  Before all this happened; the Captain and I came up with a plan; based on the QRH; that we thought was adequate.  Unfortunately; I think in our situation; the QRH was inadequate in helping us prepare our plan to mitigate the increased dry ice amounts which increased confusion about what was happening and resulted in myself feeling the effects.  Of note; we had quite a bit of dry ice loaded close to the front of the plane.  From my memory; we had 3L position loaded with +1300 lbs of dry ice.  I'm not sure if this presents a greater risk to the crew being loaded close to the front.  A couple of recommendations that would have helped the Captain and I come up with a Dry-Ice mitigation plan that would have been more realistic in our situation.Recommend adding a maximum time period with aircraft fully closed and operating on APU air.  Judging by our block in experience at ZZZ1; around 3000 lbs of dry-ice started elevating CO2 levels; with APU air/3 packs operating within 20 minutes. At a certain point; and in our situation; letting the cargo compartment air out (with APU running) for a few minutes; while maintenance had to work on our plane; would have been a prudent procedure to implement.  This might have reduced levels in the aircraft enough so that we weren't constantly dealing with our CO2 monitors going off.",,"Air Carrier flight crew reported while following the dry ice procedures for packs operated by APU before and during engine start; the carbon dioxide monitors indicated increased levels. The flight crew recommended procedures be revised to clarify the 'Pack ON/OFF' position during engine start and departure.",

And you could feel it throughout the airframe.

Minutes later while approaching the ZZZZZ intersection the aircraft encountered severe turbulence which lasted between 30 and 60 seconds. Immediately upon entering the turbulence I took control of the aircraft and at the same time Auto Pilot disconnected itself. I then endeavored to maintain a steady attitude and reduce the constant changes in pitch and roll that were being encountered. At no time did ATC note any altitudes deviations.Once the aircraft was in VMC conditions the turbulence dissipated and we noted several caution messages on the EICAS. These included: AP FAIL SPOILER FAULT ELEVATOR FAULT RUDDER FAULT.

We immediately stopped the demo. We grabbed gloves and protective gear from the kit. Once PAX finished vomiting; PAX regained consciousness. We notified the CA (Captain) immediately because we were still at the gate.  We also called for medical assistance. We were told to disarm doors and wait for ground medical crew.The passenger in distress went into the front Lav to attempt to clean themself. Medical personnel arrived and escorted the PAX off the plane. The PAX travel companion decided to get off as well. However; there was no ground personnel anywhere in sight. We told the travel companion to be patient and a ground crew would be right up to escort them to the PAX. Since the ground crew was not around (and the FWD L1 door was open) the flight attendants started to clean up the vomit. Even with 2 kits there were not enough materials to soak up the vomit; a bio hazardous material. The CA called again for ground crew to come and clean. Eventually a person came up with ONLY paper towels and one white trash bag. The flight attendants requested sanitizing products; new seat belts; vacuum; and red disposable hazmat bag because of the vomit and it being considered a bio hazardous fluid. Vomit can carry hazardous pathogens that can rapidly contaminate surfaces and the air. We had already filled four white trash bags with the vomit from just the aisle.The two FWD flight attendants have been taking trainings on bio hazardous bodily fluids for over 8~Years and we know that if vomit is not cleaned up properly then there are risks for the potential spread of diseases such as Salmonella; Norovirus; Hepatitis A & B; Typhoid; and Varicella. This was very concerning to us because the GM (general manager) had no idea how to handle this situation. The GM kept telling us that 'we don't do that' whenever we asked for things to be cleaned and sanitized. It was a very serious safety issue and we felt we weren't being heard on what was needed to clean up this extreme amount of vomit.  This was a safety issue for us as a crew and also the passengers. Safety is our #1 priority.  In the notes it states that the Captain did not want to deplane.  This is incorrect. The ground crew didn't want to deplane; so we moved the affected first X rows of passengers to the back of the plane. The ground person initially dropped off the cleaning supplies (paper towels/wipes) to the FWD galley and stood there expecting the flight attendants to clean the vomit. The flight attendants cleaned up most of it already; but we still needed industrial use sanitizer; spray; deodorizer spray for the smell; and a wet vacuum. During this time there was never a gate agent assigned to our plane. The [ground crew] person left the aircraft and we sat there not having any information; no cleaning supplies or ground cleaners. The CA called ops again for ground crew to come back and finish the clean up. At this point it had been 75 minutes and we started a pour service. The GM for ground crew company came on board and was confused about what he needed to do and continued to ask the FAs. The lead explained the medical situation and what the pilots and flight attendants had requested. He argued profusely with the flight attendants and stated that 'we don't do that'. He then said the ground crew doesn't clean the aircraft on turns; just on RON. We told him that's not the situation and we just need the plane cleaned from this medical.The GM asked us repeatedly what exactly we needed; but never brought it to us and kept saying; 'we don't do that.' Our crew was frustrated for the lack of training the company had received for hazmat and first aid. It seemed like they had no idea what precautions to take or the necessary supplies needed to clean up bodily fluid. It seemed like they wanted us to handle it all; but without any access to supplies. The GM was recording videos of the affected area with his phone after he supposedly cleaned the area. During flight several passengers said they didn't want to delay the flight any longer; but there was still a big mess of vomit on the side of the seats and especially the seat in XX. The GM seemed satisfied that the area had been cleaned. However; the seatbelt needed to be replaced and the GM said he doesn't do that either. We told him we needed one and asked who does that?  We explained that we cleaned the bathroom to help out since no one had come to our aircraft to assist. He continued to argue with us in-front of passengers claiming they don't clean the bathrooms. At this point it's embarrassing because the GM is verbally attacking us in front of pax. We were only trying to communicate that the vomit needed to be cleaned and cleaned correctly with disinfecting products. Because the GM was being loud with flight attendants in the FWD galley; passengers started to get out their phones and record. We were embarrassed and frustrated because our training tells us how to handle first aid and hazmat situations differently. The CA heard the GM and came out of the flight deck to speak with the GM. He took him onto the ramp and they exchanged words. We never got the cleaning supplies we needed after multiple attempts of telling the ground crew what we needed to clean up the vomit. The surrounding passengers complained about the smell and left over chunks on the floor. When GM came back; he asked the lead what exactly he needed to do. She explained for the second time what we needed and he left to go get it (We then found out that he went to call our supervisor). The pour service was completed by the time they came back with the necessary cleaning supplies. The GM himself cleaned whatever vomit was remaining using a microfiber towel; which only potential spread contaminates. It wasn't doing the job and again we requested a wet vacuum. The GM eventually went to get the vacuum after the CA walked out to speak with him for a second time. The GM made several unnecessary comments to the flight attendants (in front of passengers) about the seat. MX was called and they showed up to replace the seatbelt. We requested cups; trash bags; paper towels and water for passengers since we used it all for cleaning up the vomit and pour service.After reviewing the delay notes; it states that 'the pilot refused to board until mess area was cleaned again.' This is incorrect.  As stated above; we were fully boarded and the passengers never deplaned.  We only moved the first 5 rows to the back of the plane so we could clean up the affected area. The crew resource management was poorly executed by the ground company side of the operation. There needs to be consistency between flight attendants and ground crew on cleaning up bodily fluids on the aircraft so we are both on the same page.  This is very serious to me since it is a bio hazard and I don't feel confident in the proper cleanliness of the aircraft after an incident of a bio hazard has occurred.  We take tests every year to stay informed of the severity of health concerns and the way this incident was handled was very unsettling.  The GM of the airport didn't even know his job or seemed concerned about cleaning up the mess. It could be blood; stool; urine; vomit; or drool that needs to follow OSHA standards on making sure we are not spreading potential diseases.  A ground crew worker should not approach an aircraft with a roll of paper towels and a white trash bag when they are informed that a seat needs to be cleaned or a bathroom needs to be cleaned because of bodily fluids.",,,,"Air Carrier Flight Attendant reported a passenger passed out and vomited around the surrounding seating area during pre-flight.

Around 5;000 feet I entered a thermal and turned off the engine. Shortly thereafter I had a very faint fuel smell in the cabin so I turned off the fuel selector valve; something I have never done before while soaring. I flew northeast of ZZZ while monitoring ZZZ Approach and ZZZ Tower. Traffic was busy. I notified ZZZ Tower that I was the glider they were reporting traffic about. I also had traffic on two screens on my panel. ZZZ reported to me that there were multiple IFR jet flights arriving shortly into ZZZ at my altitude which probably was around 3;500 feet at the time.At that point I turned back west and descended to get below arriving traffic. As I approached [the mountain peak] I was getting too low; turned back east and started the engine. I was in a down draft at the time. I gunned the engine which suddenly stopped 5 seconds later. I had forgotten to open the fuel valve selector in that urgent situation. The only option to land at that point was on the fairway of the Golf Course. There were two fairways to choose from. One had 3 carts (14th fairway) and the other had only one cart (15th) off to the right side. I put the landing gear switch to the down position; pulled full spoilers and landed on the grass. The gear had not extended at that point and retracted back into the fuselage. The right wing tip hit the ground and the plane spun around into the opposite direction. No injuries. The gear was surprisingly undamaged; but the gear doors were damaged. The right wing tip was also damaged. The surrounding terrain was very hilly and rocky; and I suspect the outcome would have been fatal if the fairway was not accessible.Bottom line: I turned off the fuel cock which sits above and behind me; and I never have done that before. I got distracted and too low; and got myself into a situation where my check list could not be used. Lesson learned. 1. Start the engine much earlier when you are not in a situation where options are limited. 2. Don't sight see in crowded airspace. 3. Have an emergency start sequence memorized and practiced before every flight. I'm a better pilot than what I demonstrated last week; and I have been kicking myself ever since.

ZZZ was west flow and ZZZ1 and ZZZ2 were east. I coordinated a release with Sector X / Sector Y for a TBM off ZZZ3 on the Runway XX ODP. Aircraft climb runway heading to the ZZZ XXX radial then towards ZZZ2. ZZZ3 issues an initial altitude of 2100 ft. (MVA over ZZZ3) but traffic flows dictate that our exit route to ZZZZZ is radar vectors over ZZZ4 at 2000 ft. When Aircraft X checked on I radar identified them; noticed that the 2100 ft. MVA would not be a factor and issued a climb to 2000 ft. anticipating I would be able to turn them towards ZZZ4 quickly and not have to descend them back down 100 ft. or have to have Sector X stop their ZZZ2 arrivals at 3100 ft. (instead of 3000 ft.). I was wrong. I was dealing with an out of sequence feed from Sector Z as well as an aircraft that couldn't intercept the final due to weather and needed vectors across the localizer when I noticed that the TBM was not climbing like I was expecting. They had not climbed to 2000 ft. yet so I couldn't turn them towards ZZZ4. They were still heading XXY not intercepting the XXX radial and about to enter the 3000 ft. MVA. I issued a climb to 3000 ft. and a low altitude alert; advising the pilot that I couldn't turn them until they're above the current MVA and they needed to expedite their climb. I coordinated with Sector X that Aircraft X is climbing slow and issued 3000 ft. as they had a ZZZ5 arrival inbound just above 4000 ft. Sector X advised me to turn Aircraft X to a XXZ heading. I asked Aircraft X if they were able to maintain their own terrain and obstruction clearance but they were IMC. I issued passing traffic at 4000 ft. above them; another low altitude alert; the ZZZ altimeter and their current MVA and issued a XXZ heading anticipating that Sector X had more ZZZ2 downwind traffic descending to 4000 ft. opposite direction. Once the ZZZ5 traffic was no factor I issued an immediate climb to 4000 ft. and coordinated the new exit route with Sector X. I handed off the aircraft without further incident. I was relying on the aircraft to comply with the Runway XX ODP. Once the aircraft deviated from that (not intercepting the ZZZ XXX radial) there are almost no outs given the MVAs and ZZZ2 east traffic that are safe.

As I looked at it; it increased to 1.8 or 1.9 and turned Amber. Nearly three weeks prior; I had encountered nearly identical conditions on [a similar aircraft]. I advised him to reduce thrust and try to maintain Vibration at or below 1.7 indicated; as that was what the QRH procedure directed. Once out of the terminal area and during en route climb; I assigned him radio duties on top of pilot flying (PF) duties; while I ran the QRH N1 Fan Vibration procedure. I further advised the FO that if we couldn't keep it nominal and the exceedance persisted; the QRH would direct us to the Intentional Shutdown procedure.Initially; we were able to keep it at 1.7; but during our climb; it would frequently jump to 1.8 or 1.9 for longer periods of time. I checked the Maintenance Diagnostic Computer (MDC) engine exceedance screen and saw that it had jumped to 2.0 at least once for a significant duration; with multiple occurrences at 1.8 or 1.9 for several second's duration. Despite being cleared to FL340; I advised that the FO that our climb ability would deteriorate in the low to mid 20's and we should request a lower altitude from ATC. The FO also advised them of our situation. I sent ACARS notifications to Dispatch and Maintenance Control; advising we were considering diverting; our divert options; and the potential for engine shutdown. I also advised the flight attendants (FAs) of our situation and that we would update them.We discussed options for diverting; with ZZZ3 and ZZZ4 both along our route. Preemptively; knowing landing distance would be a factor if we shut down an engine; we opened the QRH to the intentional shutdown procedure. We were over maximum landing weight; so we used maximum landing weight to calculate our landing distance maximum. We then evaluated several airports to determine if they were feasible landing options. After determining that ZZZ3; ZZZ4; and ZZZ2 were all suitable; we evaluated which would be best for Maintenance and passenger connections. ZZZ2 was the most logical choice. I advised Dispatch via ACARS of our intent. I contacted Center; stated our intent to divert to ZZZ2; and requested vectors. Dispatch advised that ZZZ2 Operations had been advised and was prepared. As we had been evaluating our option; our airspeed had even slowly bleeding off at FL240 due to reduced thrust. ATC cleared us direct to ZZZ2; and discretion to 10;000 ft. I updated the FAs; and went through briefing items with them. I then advised the passengers that we were diverting to ZZZ2; that we likely would have to shutdown number two engine; and that Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) equipment would be waiting as a precaution.During our descent; the right N1 fan vibration persisted; even with vastly reduced thrust. The FO and I agreed that we should go ahead with the intentional shutdown procedure. I asked the FO if he was okay; or wanted me to take over flying and perform the landing. He indicated he was fine to continue flying. I ran the QRH; performing one task out of sequence; due to radio interruptions and task saturation on both our parts. Center turned us over to approach; and we were cleared to descend to 3;000 ft. and were given downwind vectors. The FO reminded me about our fuel/weight status; and we realized we had approximately 800 pounds to burn off to avoid landing overweight. I advised approach we needed approximately 10 minutes of vectors for that purpose. We slowed and configured to our final flap setting of 20 degrees to help. Once we were below maximum landing weight; we received vectors to final; and were cleared for the approach and landing. FO made an outstanding touchdown and we taxied to the gate without further incident.",,"I was the pilot flying (PF) from ZZZ to ZZZ1 which resulted in an intentional shutdown and diversion to ZZZ2. From preflight to taxi everything seemed to be running normally and there were no indications of engine issues. As we departed ZZZ I noticed that it was abnormally loud compared to normal. I started to think to myself what would be making it louder; then looking at the N1 vibration gauges I see that the right engine is at 1.6 but still in the normal range while the left engine is at least below .4. I then pointed this vibration out to the Captain. He had a similar issue a week or two ago so he opened the QRH to the N1 fan vibration non message page to review in anticipation of the issue getting worse. As we climbed higher the issue did worsen and the N1 vibration would reach a peak of 2.0 and settle in the 1.8 and 1.9 range; which are all in the Amber range and out of normal operating range.So we began to run the N1 fan vibration QRH which ultimately directed us to reduce thrust to attempt to keep the N1 fan vibration in the normal range; this procedure did work eventually but the N1 vibration would go back up into the amber range as we climbed with the reduced power. As we were doing this we also let ATC know about the potential issue and that we would need to stop our climb at FL240. We decided that we would see if we could control the vibration at cruise and started to work on if we would have the fuel to make it to ZZZ1 at a lower altitude as well as explore possible diversion airports of the issue could not be controlled. Even at cruise and reduced power setting the vibration continued to persist in the amber range; at this point we had been in contact with dispatch and decided it would be best to divert to ZZZ2 as it was our nearest airport and had suitable runways. We began our decent towards ZZZ2; and even in the decent at further reduced power the vibrations remained in the amber range for the right engine; at that point we said that there is no way it is getting better so we then ran the inflight engine shutdown checklist in the QRH to prevent a possible catastrophic failure.The last issue we had was that we were also going to be overweight by about 800 pounds so we decided to circle for about 10 minutes to burn fuel and get under our max landing weight; this also gave us time to get fully set up and prepared for an approach to XR at ZZZ2. Once we were confident that we were under landing weight we asked for vectors to begin the visual approach.

I turned direct to ZZZ at this point.After stabilizing the aircraft I looked outside and saw the left flap was fully deployed and the right flap was fully retracted at this point I determined the airplane had an asymmetrical flap failure. I tried retracting the flaps again; I could hear the flap motor engaging but the left flap remained down. I then attempted to put the flaps down and the right flap then deployed; bringing the flaps back into a symmetrical position however the aircraft remained without the capability to symmetrically retract flaps.

This is a common VFR route that is used by many GA aircraft. The route from ZZZ1 to ZZZ is along [a highway]; which is a bridge and causeway; running parallel with ZZZ3 Class B airspace. Before entering ZZZ class D airspace; I contacted ZZZ ATC about my intentions to transition through their airspace on the way toward ZZZ2. I was instructed to fly over the field at or above 1000 ft. At the typical point (toll plaza) I turned toward the Control Tower to fly over the center of the field. As usual; I ask for an altitude check and was told they saw me at 1000 ft.As I approached the airport; the ADS-B was starting to warn of 'TRAFFIC 10 O'CLOCK'. Just then; ATC sent a radio message 'TURN RIGHT; TURN RIGHT'; which I did. It was at that point I saw the aircraft at 10:00; approximately 200 ft. away fly past at 50 ft.  below in a climb. If my position was one second later we would have intersected. As I was taking in what just happened; the ADS-B began to warn of other traffic; so I resumed my original course toward the tower.

At ~ 10 miles south of ZZZ; my intended weather divert - I had field in sight; I'd gotten ATIS; ATC switched me to Tower; I reported as told by controller about 3 nm southeast of the field for a left Downwind to Runway XX. Before that - I asked for winds as the ATIS called gust 12 kt. winds at 260 and ZZZ was landing XX. Tower and I briefly discussed a western Runway XY landing but it was short (3000 ft.) so I declined XY and told Tower I would take the left downwind to XX to stay with incoming traffic flows; and report 3 miles. I actually told them I was then 4 miles southeast for left downwind XX. She continually cautioned me to stay east of the field; left downwind. As I entered the left downwind abeam the departure end; the ATC controller cleared flight of two L-39's in close formation to come from their initial point to do a RIGHT BREAK; Flight lead told Tower he was not set up for a Right break; he wanted to do a LEFT BREAK. Tower then switched her instructions and cleared flight for a left break; immediately the flight lead broke his jet (I'm guessing his flight was going at least 250 kts.) directly; co altitude; into me; while on my left downwind slowing to 135 kts. with 1/2 flaps down. I had on the Baron's LED landing lights; 3 strobes; port and starboard nav lights; and rotating beacon; on a white baron with green stipes. I immediately called Tower and told her 'you just broke the jets into me; they're going to hit me; I'm breaking east (to get out of the lead jets way); I called the jet leader and said 'you just broke into me; do you see me; I got no answer from lead; I told I was close enough to be his flight lead above and forward of his right wing. While he was completed his break turn to a 360 heading; I almost couldn't avoid getting hit; he was effectively rendezvousing on me while looking away; I could see the back of his helmet; he was looking right towards the runway. I couldn't get away from him fast enough as I was slowing with flaps down. I ended up 500 ft. away off his wing and slightly high. At that point the Tower controller started breaking down. She sounded elderly; very confused; very rattled; very apologetic; with absolutely no situational awareness; she then commenced apologizing and then she started making excuses; twice saying 'we don't have radar in the cab; we didn't see you; what are you going to do now?; we didn't know you were there; etc.'If you look at the Flight Aware track on Aircraft X; you'll see how hard I had to turn away and climb to get away from the lead; Aircraft Y. Aircraft Z broke late and was south of this 'merger' on downwind. I extended my downwind to let Aircraft Z turn base / final; and both jets land; and then I followed the 2nd jet. Inexplicably; the controller allowed other aircraft in or near her pattern as this group of 3 sorted it out. In my opinion; I was witnessing two L-39's on an enroute stopover to an airshow by flying a military formation to a break maneuver; they were cleared to break right; they pushed a weak controller into clearing them to break left into the established traffic pattern; the controller had no situational awareness; and my passenger and I came with 500 ft. of getting hit by the lead. Only to qualify what I saw; I will state I [have decades of military fighter jet experience]; we always flew formation into the break; the flight flew a great formation and looked 'pretty' right up until I started calling for the leader to watch out for me; as he was about to hit me.  After landing; I refueled my airplane; then I walked over to discuss the near accident with leader. I asked him if he ever saw me on downwind and he said 'no; but he was cleared to break left '. I asked #2 if he saw me; he said no; but that 'we could not accept the right break because he was in welded wing'; which was his explanation for whyhe didn't see me. He said 'in formation; all he saw was leader's wing '. The pilots were 'wary' they had caused a bad situation; they were cautious with their words; but the sum total of their dialogue was they felt they were cleared to do what they did; and they did it. They both told me directly they never saw me on downwind and I believe that. I also firmly believe the Tower didn't have any situational awareness on the pattern. I feel blessed by enough experience to know what to expect once the two jets I was watching carefully were cleared to break left; and yet I was surprised I almost couldn't pull hard enough to get out of their way quickly enough. My passenger watched the whole thing; she was scared we were going to get hit; she is not used to seeing closure rates like that; she is not familiar with the 'g' I put on the Baron to break east and away from the L-39. This reminds me of the airshow accident P-39 hitting the B-17 recently. Where were his eyes; before impact?? The flight wasn't at an airshow; they were 50 miles north of ZZZ3. I was mad as hell at them; my passenger was very afraid of what she saw; even more so after we landed. She saw too much of the L-39 coming at us; from the right seat; as we turned right. I wished them luck at the airshow; but they didn't need to practice their breaks at ZZZ into a pattern that had more than me in it.",,,,"Beechcraft Barron pilot reported a NMAC while in the pattern at a towered airport.

The FM (Flight Manual) only indicated that we had to monitor the air data information if standby instruments were used. Our maintenance history showed that this was a repeat write up and I proceeded to send a maintenance request code through ACARS. The ECAM was cleared and the screens were normal.We initiated our descent into ZZZ with Autopilot2 engaged west of the ZZZ1 VOR when we received another ECAM; this time for a L/G Shock Absorber Fault. Before we could even address that; we received the Autopilot Disconnect Warning Tone; an Auto Thrust Lock ECAM; and both Flight Directors (FDs) failed. We regained manual control of the throttles and FO continued to fly with the flight path vector selected and leveled off at FL220. We attempted to reengage the Autopilot; Auto Throttles and Flight Directors to no avail.

Since the FMGCs did not recover we attempted the short FMGC reset with no effect. An ARINC three-way call was set up with Dispatch and Maintenance Control to discuss our plan of action since our approach capability was limited to raw data ILS and visual approaches. The only ILS available at ZZZ was for Runway XYR and the winds were out of the southeast at 16 kts. so that was out of the question. The weather in ZZZ2 was also questionable with low ceilings and strong cross winds. ZZZ3 was VFR so we agreed to divert there. We advised ZZZ Center. They were advised of our situation and radar vectors were provided to ZZZ3.

We were preparing for taxi and takeoff. The runway had changed and we were preparing the avionics adjustments and briefing while taxiing. I am also doing IOE (Initial Operating Experience) with a new student. Upon reaching the approaching the end of the Runway XXL in ZZZ my student calls the Tower to notify of our readiness for takeoff. The Tower Controller keys his mike and talks over him and interrupted his transmission. My student; thinking they had accidentally interrupted the Tower; transmits our readiness again. The controller then reprimands them for calling and used very inappropriate language and an angry style. It was completely unwarranted. The controller had been communicating with everyone in an aggressive and inciting tone. We had commented about it during our taxi. While I was briefing the new departure I thought my partner had missed a call so I replied back. Unfortunately Tower was talking to someone else instead of me. I apologized to the Tower for taking someone else's call.Later the controller told us 'finally!! you are up next.' Then proceeded to ask us why we had' interrupted him and cause so much confusion for him; taking other aircraft's calls and what was going on?' I was confused at the series and tone of questioning and stated that I did not know what he was talking about. I think I did know; but that was not the venue to have that type of discussion or create a debate or argue about it nor was it the appropriate professional tone to use. In his anger; he loudly reprimanded me again and stated 'You don't know what I am talking about?' I paused; then to the controller I stated 'let's keep this professional' hoping it would create a more calming environment and situation and diffuse his angry moment. It seemed to work. After that he had told us we were up next to take off; however; he allowed one or two more planes take off before us. I felt he was delaying us deliberately at that point just to punish us. I feel that type of behavior is unprofessional; uncalled for; and unnecessary.We had a company VIP onboard who was very anxious to go and it was stated in ours notes of the time critical nature of the flight. Causing an intentional delay for retribution is critical and can be damaging not only to the safety of the flight but also to the passengers purpose for conducting business. In essence; the controller is not delaying the crew; but the passengers. Busy radios are the norm and interruptions happen frequently. On a daily basis. We as professionals try very hard to minimize the interruptions and figure out ways to consolidate conversations by communicating most effectively in the fewest amount of words but maximizing understanding. However when controllers do not articulate and get overwhelmed therefore the communication breakdown begins. That is compounded when a controller or pilot becomes angry and allows their anger to be verbalized over the radio. The controller should have recognized the issue at hand and stepped back rather than making an attempt to embarrass someone. They are the ones who can slow things down when they become task saturated. Articulate. Speak clearly. Channel your anger. Leave it at the door when coming to work. I also understand the issues. Some IOE students with limited experience do not have the experience to draw from like someone who has 30 years experience. They will not be eloquent or efficient sometimes. We were all there.There is enough pressure on flight crews without having a controller amplify a situation into an unsafe situation. This controller turned a difficult situation into something much more dangerous. Pressuring and criticizing a flight crew right before takeoff creates a monster of distractions and causes confusion and communication breakdown. I almost turned around and went back to the gate. I asked my students if he was ok and took a moment to regroup before takeoff. I used the situation as a 'teachable moment" to explain whathad happened. Mistakes happen; but always maintain a higher level of safety and professionalism. I have emphasized the importance of clarifying clearances and asking again if not certain. Controllers are becoming increasingly less articulate; hurried; and angry; and hostile when asked to repeat. More mistakes happen when pilots are intimidated and afraid to ask for clarification in fear of be publicly humiliated by a controller. This behavior is unsafe and growing among ATC. I feel this should be taken seriously and should be a growing concern. If a violation or accident happens who suffers the consequences? The crew and passengers. So why are we pressured and humiliated by controllers?",,,,"Fractional Jet Captain reported the Tower Controller spoke unprofessionally and berated and reprimanded the flight crew due to a miscommunication and then deliberately delayed their takeoff clearance seemingly as punishment.",

This was our third session of the day; and we had previously discussed the fact that position X has frequent pilot deviations; mostly with the ZZZ1 departure. We discussed the importance of issuing the BRASHER statement; not to get pilots in trouble; but to educate the pilots and ensure the unsafe situation isn't repeated. ZZZ Tower called to request a release from Runway XX for a ZZZ One departure. Off Runway XX; the aircraft should turn northbound to heading XXX once they are through 5000 ft. The aircraft was released and departed shortly thereafter. The aircraft checked in climbing to 10;000 ft. on the ZZZ One and was radar identified.After some time and additional transmissions to other aircraft; we noticed the aircraft was still westbound as if on runway heading. The CPC-IT asked the pilot to verify they were on the ZZZ One departure; to which they responded 'affirmative; vectors to ZZZZZ.' I understand the intent behind asking if the pilot was on the departure. An expected possible response could've been 'Affirmative; in the right turn now;' as some pilots don't make this turn right away. Unfortunately; this aircraft continued into higher MVAs and a low altitude alert was never issued. The next departure from Runway XX; also on the ZZZ One; went into a higher MVA; but they were following the departure procedure correctly and made the turn appropriately. In most cases; 'appropriately' still leads to the aircraft getting into a higher MVA before making the turn northbound.

Aircraft climbed and was turned on course upon reaching a higher altitude above the MVA (12000). Due to the issues related to giving or implying a heading below the MVA; I opted to allow the aircraft to climb above the MVA before issuing a turn on course. I hesitated giving the pilot deviation advisory due to the aircraft still being in a climb underneath the flight levels but was instructed to by my trainer. It is still my belief that such instruction should be delayed until the aircraft is in level flight and on course or already on the ground.

We continued our climb; and I; as the Pilot Monitoring; got the QRH out to address the issue. The circuit breaker had not popped; but the voltmeter showed 0. As per the QRH; I elected to replace the fuse for the alternator; and attempt a reset; based on the facts that it was low IFR everywhere nearby; we were going to be IMC for the entire flight; and there was a possibility for icing - as we had witnessed trace ice earlier that day and there was mixed precipitation supposedly close to ZZZ1; our destination. I followed the steps in the QRH; and when turning the right alternator switch breaker back on; both alternator out lights illuminated as well as the low voltage light; backed up by 0 on the voltmeter for both alternators. Considering the weather conditions; my first action was to [request priority handling] with ZZZ approach; and request a return to ZZZ as we troubleshot. Fortunately for us; ZZZ had just switched runways to XXR and XXL; so we would have a 180 turn from our current track; onto the localizer for XXR. As the First Officer was flying; I opened the QRH and went to the dual alternator failure checklist. I replaced the fuse for the left alternator and turned it back on. It came alive; and I opted not to turn the right alternator back on; as it had caused the issue to begin with. After the alternator came back on and as we were getting vectored for the ILS XXR; I notified the Passengers that we had a minor mechanical issue and that for their safety we would be landing back in ZZZ shortly. They were quiet but not alarmed. Upon landing and shutdown; I explained in minor detail to the passengers that we had a partial electrical power situation and given the weather today; we decided to return back to land and that they would be taken care of. They were cooperative and understanding. I think electing to replace the fuse and attempt a restart of the right alternator caused the left alternator to fail.

The planned sequence was to return the same aircraft and crew to ZZZ after a regular scheduled ground turn in ZZZZ.The flight from ZZZ to ZZZZ was uneventful; although the flight crew observed the in the log described high flashing indication accompanied with the previously mentioned vibration values in the log. No airframe vibrations were observed. The return flight with the First Officer (FO) as pilot flying (PF); departed ZZZZ Runway XXL on a radar vectored departure with subsequent direct navigation to ZZZZZ to join the flight plan route. Climbing through approximately 26;000 ft.; the aircraft experienced suddenly moderate to high airframe vibrations occurring continuously; while the engine N2 vibration indications repeatedly and intermittently varied between normal and exceeded values. Initially no ECAM messages were displayed. After standard SOP call outs (my aircraft; etc.); we re-established the initial roles of PF (FO) and pilot monitoring (PM) (Captain); while beginning to assess the situation at hand. The Captain contacted ATC and requested to maintain current altitude due to technical problem and we leveled off slightly above 27;000 ft.By now the ECAM message ENG 1 HIGH VIBRATION was displayed intermittently; upon which the Captain informed ATC about our intentions to return to ZZZZ [requesting priority handling] and requesting initial radar vectors; descent clearance and Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) assistance upon arrival. We received a southerly heading and an initial descent to 20;000 ft.During the situational assessment; multiple calls were received from ATC and cabin who were understandably seeking information; which slowed us down slightly.My focus was on flying the aircraft; initiating descent; and reducing air speed to 250 kts. to minimize airframe vibration and managing time. The highest vibration value noticed by me as PF was 9.8 Units.A few seconds later with the ENG 1 HIGH VIBRATION now being displayed continuously; we performed the ECAM actions for high vibration. As I moved the #1 thrust lever towards Idle; the ECAM changed to ENG 1 FAIL. Following standard communication protocols; the Captain performed the ECAM actions; leading to shutting down the #1 Engine and starting the APU. We agreed not to attempt a restart of the failed engine. The Captain continued with the QRH follow up items and managing communication with Dispatch; Cabin; and ATC; while I continued as PF and setup the aircraft for a VOR Runway XXL/Flap 3 approach to ZZZZ. With the QRH follow up items complete; Dispatch informed via ACARS 7700; flight attendants and passengers briefed and cleared by ATC directly to the IAF for the VORXXL; we switched PF/PM roles for landing; with the Captain now PF asking me to double-check the QRH follow up items for After Engine Shutdown.Following a quick approach briefing; an uneventful; well flown single engine approach and landing on Runway XXL (approximately 2;500 pounds over maximum landing weight/offset runway) under VFR conditions was performed.

Additionally; we had a pilot in the jump seat. The flight was successful and without incident prior to reaching the gate. Upon pulling short of the gate; the ground crew slowly got into position to direct us in. The Marshaller was just standing in position with no action. After a few minutes without marshalling signals and shrugs from the wing walkers as if they were gesturing 'what's going on' I slightly increased power while holding brakes as an audible we are ready to come into the gate. At this time the Marshaller began gesturing what the FO; jump seater and I ascertained to be come forward. As it seems to be standard practice; particularly at ZZZ; the marshalling was non-standard to any FAA; ICAO or military signals any of us where aware of. First Officer commented that it looks like the Marshaller was using a skiing motion with the Marshaller's hands next to his hips. The jump seater also commented something similar to the effect of how horrible and unacceptable this was. I continued to taxi at the slowest and safest rate possible aligning myself on the centerline despite the Marshallers nonstandard directions. Within a few seconds the Marshaller gave us what we interpreted a turn to our left that resembled a 'dabbing' motion followed quickly with a no notice stop motion. I stopped as quickly as possible considering the passengers and situation. However; this was a distance past where the nose wheel is indicated on the ramp for the CRJ to stop; but in no means a location that would cause damage to the aircraft or harm to the passengers. The Marshaller clearly at this time said 'For [expletive] sakes' and made an aggressive throwing his hands down motion. I set the parking brake and First Officer released the passengers with the seat belt sign. After a moment; the Marhsaller indicated the chocks were in and at that time I released the jump seater and called for the shutdown check. Within seconds; the Marshaller came into the cockpit where he began to berate us for not following his instructions; in-front of the full cabin of shocked passengers; the flight attendant and the jump seater. I stated in my most professional way that I cannot stop the aircraft that quickly and he needed to use correct signals. He continued to want to escalate the situation; but I let him know if we needed to be pushed back; then we will. I then made an announcement to the passengers apologizing; and asked them to return to their seats; fasten their seat belts and stow their bags. Immediately after he left the cockpit the First Officer and myself ran appropriate checklists and while waiting for the pushback discussed how inappropriate this was and that we should make a report. We decided in the moments we had until pushback to make a quick call to Operations about the issue and they informed us they would be letting the Ramp Lead know. While being reconnected to the tug; the standard phraseology and hand gestures were used to capture the aircraft just prior to us pushing back. The Marshaller in question then through the headsets said 'I can hear you guys' to which a reply was made; 'It's no secret mate; I don't mind if you hear; we'll be filing a report and speaking with your supervisor'. The Marshaller kept muttering through the headsets about us not following the Marshaller's instructions and that he can hear us talking; etc. To which I replied with 'Okay; just stop; you need to push us back so we can get these passengers off the airplane and stop arguing; we will talk about it later'. This whole interaction cost passengers approximately X minutes of delay on deboarding the aircraft. Looking back at the incident we should have communicated with Operations earlier about the lack of initially moving into the gate and the non-standard marshalling signals we were receiving. Issues: SAFETY. ZZZ marshalling is atrocious. It is nonstandard and I recommenda complete retraining of all ground personal on proper techniques found within the AIM. While this issue is not isolated to ZZZ; it is the most egregious place concerning this matter. It is becoming dangerous. Marshallers at ZZZ continually marshal with hands in front of body rather than overhead and clearly seen. At night it is lucky if marshallers and wing walkers have 1 lit wand. It has become far too common for the ground crews to expect to not conduct aircraft movement with operable headsets. This is extremely dangerous when at night; in the weather and multiple pushback instructions are given. Professionalism. It looks bad for Company A and Company B when this type of incident occurs. There is a time and place for crews and ramp personnel or others to have conversations and a way to have them; this did not happen. Suggestions. Conduct training on proper ground ops signals. Obtain and use operable headsets. If ZZZ can budget to get radar like ZZZ1. Lessons learned/ to pass on - Stop aircraft and coordinate with Operations with any issues immediately. I feel as a crew; the First Officer and Flight Attendant and myself acted in a safe and professional manner. We communicated and apologized to the passengers. We debriefed and wrote these reports and we continued with our duties for the day isolating the incident to not distract from safety or CRM on future flights.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain reported the Marshaller did not use their headset to communicate and used non standard hand movements resulting in confusion and a delay parking the aircraft.",

While being vectored to the final approach course; the Controller did not turn me in on time and I had to turn back to intercept (020 heading). This put us further down the approach and we were still at 2;500 feet; I powered back and put the gear; flaps and speed brakes out to descend and slow down. The auto pilot did not capture GS after switching from heading mode to approach mode. I disconnected autopilot to hand fly the approach. we broke out at around 1;200 feet. We were very high and had a 20 knot tail wind and only 4;000 feet of runway. I continued the approach and when I arrived at my go around point I powered up for the go around. I selected gear up and flaps up and started a slow climb. I noticed the airspeed indicator was indicating only 95 knots at TOGA power setting and the aircraft did not climb. I confirmed gear up but found that the flaps were still full down with the selector all the way up. I was 1/2 mile or so upwind and decided to [request priority handling] and circle back to Runway XX. I did not want to enter the clouds with the flaps full. I did a normal pattern and landed without incident. Resetting the flap warning circuit breaker did allow me to retract the flaps after the incident. Like most incidents or accidents; it is a chain of events at fault. We started the approach high; had to intercept twice; the auto pilot did not engage properly; we had a tailwind (no approach available from the north and no circling approach available). These factors lead to the go around. This exposed the issue of the flaps not retracting and created a hazardous situation. I cycled the flaps on the preflight and they operated with no issues. Flying into the clouds with stuck flaps is dangerous and I decided to [request priority] to avoid any more potential hazards.",,,,"PA-46 pilot reported the flaps did not retract during go around and aircraft was not climbing.

We got our work around XA30 as we usually did and the 4 of us grouped together to plan out who was to be working as a team and on what tasks. Person A and I were a pair and Person B and Person C were the other pair. Person A and I had worked on the number one engine that evening as our main tasks. Throughout the night other than brief interactions the two teams did not interact too much. More towards the later hours of the morning; Person A and I had come to the conclusion of our work. During our final clean up and second checks it came to my attention that; due to a leak in the number one tire; the other team wanted to change the tire. I offered my helping hand to have the job go smoother; because I was available and did not want to simply abandon these guys in the cold alone while i returned to the office to rest while they worked. Firstly; everyone set off quickly to acquire all the different tools and parts that are needed to do the change. I believe I was in the bathroom when everyone broke and so proceeded to run back to the office where the tires are kept to aid in its acquisition given how heavy they are. I helped Person B get the tire from the container and rolled it over onto the tire jack cart which Person C had already positioned and connected to the truck. I got in the vehicle with him and we drove back over to the plane. Once we got there I exited and dropped the ramp to roll the wheel off of the cart. Person C and I rolled it together over to the gear and leaned it up on the number two tire so it would be out of the way; he then proceeded to disconnect the cart; move it together over to the gear and position the jack; Person B worked the tanks while I worked the jack and in little time we had the plane jacked up and ready to go. I then stepped away to start signing off and reviewing the work that I had done earlier that evening. When I returned to the tire job; since I already had my iPad out; I offered to write up the tire discrepancy for Person B after asking if they had done so already. I wrote it up for them and then proceeded to fill out the component replacement paperwork for them since it is a bit of a hassle. By the time I was done with that they were ready to take the old tire off and so I wheeled over the tire raiser cart jack piece of equipment and positioned it under the tire. I then stood by passing time and awaited their go ahead to jack it up to cradle the tire. They removed the tire while I moved the cradle back off the axle. Once I cleared it was safe I dropped the cradle down to get the tire on the ground. I rolled the tire away over and leaned it up against the truck. I do not remember If I aided in rolling or positioning the new tire over but I did man the wheel cradle jack again. I forgot who but someone positioned the new wheel onto the cradle jack and when everyone was ready I jacked it up and positioned the tire and worked with them to get the proper height on the jack so that the tire would go onto the axle. Once I saw that it was on; I lowered the jack; moved it out of the way and got myself out of the way so that they could work. At this time; I stepped away to the old tire for a bit to see and watch Person C deflate the old tire and to briefly banter with him while we waited. Sometime later I noticed that Person B was having a hard time with the tire and I commented that I did not believe it was seated all the way or properly on the axle. When it was decided; by them; they wanted to take the tire all the way off and try again; I got the tire cradle jack again and positioned it just as I had done previously; I got the cradle up; We took the tire off and I got it out of the way while they investigated the axle. I noticed that they found the old tire's bearing still in and on the axle. I briefly took note of them removing it; but did not really pay attention to it.My attention was on my phone while I was waiting for them to say they were ready to put the new tire back on. When they said they were ready; I positioned the new tire just as I had done before and aided them in getting it back on the axle. My next steps mirrored exactly what I had done previously. I lowered the cradle and got it out of the way and then stepped aside myself. From this point forward I was more of a floater just hanging out until the job was done or helping clean the odd thing here or there. At one point I did assist with holding the torque wrench in place as they had made a commotion about it not working properly or having a hard time with it. I held it in place briefly. It seemed to work fine and then I stepped away again to help clean up dirty rags around until everything was done with. At the very end I did help Person B put the cap back on the tire as it's a pain to do alone to fish that bolt back through the other cap. Afterwards; I went with Person C to return the torque wrench and tire change kit. When we got back to the office I proceeded to go about my own business.I was shocked and mortified to find out a couple days later when I was informed that the tire had experienced a rather catastrophic failure. Over the past few days it has come to my attention that a spacer was left out on the inner portion of the axle. My heart dropped as I remembered the issue Person B had had getting the tire on and that they had removed the old bearing. I immediately came to the conclusion that the spacer must have accidentally been removed as well and put to the side. I never really saw the bearing after the brief moment they took it out and thought nothing of it at the time. My experience with the 767 tire change is limited having only really done it maybe once before this. I was unaware of the fact that that spacer even existed. I came to find out later that it is mentioned specifically in the manual. I assumed that the manual had been used as you need it to get the torque values. Since I was only helping in a supportive logistical role I did not have the reference open myself and just tried to stay out of the way when I was not needed.",,"Task - remove and replace number 1 Tire and Wheel assembly. 767-300. Aircraft X. The proper tooling and MLG (Main Landing Gear) tire change kit were acquired.  During the service check; that particular tire pressure was low. Upon further troubleshooting the valve stem was determined to be leaking. The valve stem was tightened into the wheel bringing the air leak to almost a complete stop. A leak check was preformed to determine this. Against my judgement it was determined by one tech out of four that he wanted to remove and replace the tire. While working the remove and replace task some difficulty was encountered trying to install the tire on the axle. The tire and wheel assembly would not slide completely on the axle. Upon further investigation; it was discovered that the original inner wheel bearing and seal remained on the axle. When the original wheel bearing and seal were removed the inner wheel spacer obviously went with it unnoticed. This assembly of parts was placed on top of the old wheel and tire assembly for further inspection. After inspecting the new wheel and tire assembly for the inner wheel bearing and determining it was complete; then returning to the old tire wheel assembly only to find the old bearings were reinstalled in the old tire and capped up by another technician. So then going back to the new tire wheel assembly we then continued on with the assembling of the new tire; wheel and it slid on the axle all the way properly. After referencing the AMM for torque value; the axle nut was installed and torqued with the proper tooling. Proper torquing took two attempts because of the special tooling required reset twice. The preload and proper torque was achieved and the gland nut locking bolts were installed. Required amount of threads looked correct. Two. This having been my first 767 MLG tire replacement I felt confident all was in order. I also felt pressure that all tasks must be done in a timely manner and should not take triple time.",,"Technicians reported communication and coordination problems led to not installing a brake axle spacer when replacing a main wheel tire assembly.

Inside the FAF we experienced what appeared to be a minor encounter with wake turbulence; I don't remember who we were following but it wasn't a heavy; maybe an A320. The aircraft acted normal with a small rocking of the wings and slight pitch variation. However; the stall protection system acted quite aggressively; disconnecting the autopilot and shooting the low speed awareness tape up and the PLI (Pitch Limit Indicator) down hitting the shaker for a few clacks. The FO (First Officer) was flying and continued to do so. After this brief encounter we ended up a little high; about 1/4 dot. I instructed the FO to continue the descent following the FPA (Flight Path Angle) of 3 degrees. This would keep us mirroring the glide path but just above it hopefully out of any further wake.The encounter was brief; just a second and the aircraft returned to normal. There was no further turbulence. However; a few seconds later descending below 1500 ft the low speed awareness tape as well as the PLI started again being wildly erratic. They jumped from normal all the way to our airspeed and pitch attitude causing shaker activation. ( the only thing I can equate it to is what they do in severe wind shear when we practice that in the sim.... However after our brief encounter with the presumed wake turbulence flight conditions were smooth).The FO and I evaluated the situation and knowing that the energy state of the aircraft was normal; we were already configured for landing and that it was VFR; we elected to continue the approach after verifying there was no airspeed mismatch and all other indications were normal. In order to keep the stall protection system from activating as it continued to wildly vary both the low speed awareness tape and PLI we added 10 KTS to our approach speed and landed normally. In our judgment taking this unknown error airborne with a go around where the only EICAS message was 'shaker anticipated' was more of a risk than the continued approach. While then extra speed was not accounted for in our landing numbers 13L is 10k feet long more than enough to account for the extra speed. We were much more comfortable continuing the last 1500 ft than increasing power and more importantly pitch in a go around; we definitely didn't want to ride the shaker if we could help it longer than was necessary.After landed we got EICAS messages of ADS prob 1;2;4 fail. We wrote up the discrepancy in the log book.We did not declare an emergency in fact it didn't even cross my mind while in the air our hands were very full trying to evaluate what was actually happening and formulating a plan. Had we gone around I would hope that we would have declared one as we definitely would have been in need of priority handling.",,,,"Embraer Captain reported the stall protection system reacted in an unusual manner after a minor wake turbulence encounter.",

Crew was asked to do a maintenance check flight for Aircraft X. This was a ground test. Before starting the engines; we were informed that we would not have GPU available because the battery was dead. We started both engines; 1 and 2 on battery. A full engine run up and test of the bleed valves was completed and all checks were normal. Crew shut down aircraft normally. There was another request to do a second maintenance engine run. This time we had a GPU available to us. Crew started engine 1 with the GPU. At 20% minimum ENG RPM when the Captain introduces fuel with the condition lever; the GPU tripped off and the cockpit had erroneous readings and the engine over temp light was on. First Officer (FO) calls for cutoff and motor. Airplane engine was motored for the limitation time and below 175 degrees C. The crew used the QRH and followed procedures. Maintenance was called and notified. It was later discovered that the GPU used for the attempted engine start; was not our normal GPU and was thought to have come from Company A on the other side of the airport (I don't know officially where the GPU came from). In addition; that GPU is not able to handle a SAAB engine start. The flight crew was unaware of this. The crew spoke to Person A. He asked if we could confirm a light off. The flight crew could not determine of the engine had lit off or not. If we could be certain the engine did not light off; we could attempt a second start. If it was suspected of a light off; then the ETM/FDR (Engine Trend Monitoring/Flight Data Recorder) would have to be pulled for analysis. Person A suggested erring on the side of caution; I agreed. It was suspected that false readings were given due to the GPU being tripped; however could not confirm. I stated to the Captain that I wasn't comfortable starting the engine again; because we weren't certain. While driving home; I received a call from the Captain that I needed to return to the airport because Maintenance wanted to have us do an engine run. I was surprised by this; after what was discussed earlier. I called Person A again and he stated exactly what we spoke about earlier; there were no changes.I told the Captain I was not comfortable with starting on the phone. I returned to the airport and met him on the ramp. I stated again I was not comfortable; he said I was on duty and had to. I told him respectfully I don't and I'm not going to. I exited the airport and returned to the parking lot. The Captain did an engine start on the airplane single pilot. I'm unaware of what happened after. I called Person B to inform him of what occurred.

As we approached the final segment of taxiway near the Runway XX threshold; we observed Aircraft Y facing North in a run up pad located on the North side of the taxiway. I observed that a portion of their left wing protruded enough into my taxi route and deemed it prudent to discontinue my taxiing. I then advised ATC that I was unable to continue; I stated that I would wait for the completion of Aircraft Y runup. The pilot stated that they would be a while and suggested that we seek another alternative. I asked if they could taxi deeper into the pad. I observed them maneuver the aircraft deeper into the pad and I chose to exit the taxiway centerline in the opposite direction to increase the distance between the two aircraft. As I slowly taxied past their aircraft; constantly looking out my side window to assess our proximity; I observed their arm extended out of their side window with thumbs up. I confirmed a final time as our wing tips cleared; or I believed to have cleared; before returning my aircraft to the centerline of the taxiway just short of the runway.As we awaited our take-off clearance; ATC asked if we cleared Aircraft Y. We responded affirmative; and that we were ready for take-off. ATC then advised that the pilot suspects we struck their wing. Though I did not believe this was true; I asked to return to the ramp and the FBO to conduct a visual inspection. Upon inspection; I noted evidence that a wing clipping had occurred on the upper extremities of our left winglet. I do not know how this occurred as the image of my wing clearing their wing remains seared in my mind. I cannot say with certainty that I was the only aircraft in movement. I believed at the time that I was; but cannot substantiate this belief.During taxi for take-off at ZZZ; as I approached the final segment of the taxiway; there was a Aircraft Y performing an engine run up with the aircraft facing me. As a small portion of their wing appeared to protrude into the taxiway I was using to reach the departure runway; I stopped the aircraft and advised ATC that I was unable to continue my taxi. ATC asked if there was anything they could do for me to allow access to the runway. The pilot in the Aircraft Y said that they would be a while. I asked if they could pull into the run up pad a little deeper. They moved the aircraft slightly inward more and I departed the center line in the opposite direction to increase our distance apart. As I slowly taxied past Aircraft Y; I observed their arm extending out of the cockpit window showing thumbs up; a signal that all is clear. As I passed the wing tip; I observed adequate lateral distance between the two wing tips. I continued back to the centerline of the taxiway and the PNF reported ready for departure. It was then that Tower advised that the pilot reported that we struck their wing. I asked to return to the gate for inspection. Upon inspection; I noted evidence on the winglet indicating that a clipping event had occurred. I am not certain if I was the only aircraft moving when the impact occurred. Neither my First Officer or I felt an impact during the taxi. I still recall seeing the final glimpse of my wing clearing their wing with space between the two and cannot explain how the two aircraft came into contact during that maneuver.In retrospect; I should have insisted that they move the aircraft to another location or I should have waited. I maneuver my aircraft on very congested ramps in equally restrictive areas (GA ramps); and cannot explain how we came into contact. Perhaps; ATC could have disallowed an aircraft such as this to do a run up in a pad of such limited space. Again; in the end; I view my decision to attempt a maneuver as a lapse of judgment. I also lent undeserving trust in their hand signals. I took for granted that from the high vantage point; they were well situated to detect an existential threat. I was also comfortable with my vantage point in assessing our proximity. Apparently; this proved to be a flawed vantage point.",,"When taxing on taxiway to the hold short of Runway XX; we saw Aircraft Y on the run up area facing North; its left wing was outside the run up area; we advised the Ground Controller that we could not continue taxi because we did not have enough room to clear the wing. We asked the Aircraft Y pilots to move far to the right so we could pass through; they moved it and we saw enough space to go through and the Aircraft Y pilot gave us the thumb up confirming to us that we were clear. We passed; we did not feel anything; any airplane movement or anything and continued to the hold short and then we were advised by the Ground Controller that the two wings clipped.",,"Pilots reported while taxiing and attempting to navigate their aircraft around a parked aircraft; the wings clipped one another.",

HAZMAT carried was an evacuation slide. Ramp Agent handed the HAZMAT form directly to me as the Captain. I asked what it was and signed the form. I believe it was near departure time when this transpired and possibly interrupted a briefing or a checklist. Therefore; it likely got dismissed and the procedure to contact Dispatch or amend the Release got forgotten.This problem can be easily solved with an additional party verification of HAZMAT on board in the loop. That being the operation agent. Having ramp agent go directly to the operation agent; who then is notified to contact Dispatch for the amendment. The operation agent then brings down the HAZMAT form with an amended release or notification to the Captain to contact Dispatch for pen and ink change for expediency. In this case; the ramp agent went directly to the Captain; bypassing the operation agent; who is a key member in the loop to insure the flights safety. Yes it's the Captain's ultimate responsibility; but changing the protocol to where the Captain deals directly with the operation agent on matters vs directly with the ramp agent. This can help minimize errors and add an extra crucial teammate to the loop of checks and balances. Ramp agent; operation agent; Dispatch; then Captain should be notified in that order for best efficiency in order to get the flight out on time with minimal notification errors.",,"At the gate in ZZZ; some last minute HAZMAT (raft or life vest I believe) was loaded into the cargo without calling Dispatch and getting the Release amended.

On departure; ZZZ Departure had us turn right to an initial heading of 035 degrees to go North of the restricted airspace around and over ZZZ2 and East of ZZZ. It appears that ATC was going to take us down the interstate; past the restricted airspace to the East; and then turn us back on a VFR direct flight path to ZZZ1. However; my friend following us on the same flight path in Aircraft Y was given a left turn by ZZZ Departure to a heading of 200. I then contacted ZZZ Departure to ask for the right downwind departure; if possible; in order to save some flight time and keep us closer to the airport during what is usually considered a critical phase of flight. I made ZZZ Departure aware that I was familiar with the restricted airspace east of ZZZ and would remain clear and not violate that airspace. This was then approved by ZZZ Departure and thus I read back that approval and then proceeded into the right hand turn to execute the right downwind departure for XXR at ZZZ. The flight proceeded normally and we continued our climb towards our requested cruising altitude of 5500 ft. We passed over the river southeast of ZZZ and had reached a distance of around 5.5 miles from the field at around 5100 ft. MSL. This is where I believed that I noticed a slight drop in oil pressure. However; the oil pressure was still showing in the upper green arc limit on the display; so I didn't think anything of it at first and continued the climb towards 5500 ft. A few moments later; the pressure began to drop rapidly and an indication of such was shown on the display. I immediately disconnected the plane's autopilot system; regained manual control; made an immediate left turn back towards XXR at ZZZ and contacted Departure to advise them of the loss of oil pressure and the need for an immediate return to the field. I then consulted my immediate procedures checklist; for the airplane; in the event of loss of oil pressure and followed those procedures correctly. ZZZ Departure [requested priority handling] on our behalf; had emergency vehicles roll; and cleared us into Runway XXR for the return. Departure also instructed us to remain with them and that we did not require switching to the ZZZ Tower frequency as they would work me in to the runway. I then executed the immediate checklist review again and returned the aircraft successfully to Runway XXR. The engine began to grind as the remainder of the oil was being sent overboard out of the oil system and engine. We successfully landed and pulled off the runway onto the taxiway and up to the maintenance hangar. At this point; the engine begins to appear to seize. Maintenance personnel at the hangar take a look at the aircraft and note that the clamp around the oil reservoir of the system; from the oil change they performed the day before; was not on correctly and this was the source of where the oil was being ejected from the engine/system. They admitted negligence/fault at that moment (both Mechanic and later shop owner) as to the cause of the incident at that time.I am filing this report; as I have not received a phone call from any personnel from the FAA regarding this incident and have been made aware by the shop owner; that they have been dealing with an FAA Inspector.

This phenomenon was observed on aircraft during unscheduled maintenance due to complaints of loss of power and also during routine scheduled maintenance. Particulate accumulation also found in check valves; auxiliary fuel pumps and mechanical engine pumps. Clumps and screen obstruction observed. This has been observed over the past four months; since aircraft started using UL94 (Unleaded 94 Octane). The exact source of the cadmium is not definitively determined at this time.We suspect the cadmium is held in suspension in the fuel and in addition to accumulating and clogging the fuel system some particles are entering the combustion chamber with unknown impacts on cylinders; valves and exhaust systems. A simple experiment was conducted. Aviation cadmium bolts were placed in 100LL and UL94 for a few hours. The bolts in 100LL remain intact with no change. The bolts in UL94 showed flaking with particles suspended in the fuel sparkling. Cleaning of all fuel parts in the fuel systems clears the problem but it reappears.  We are concerned since we have limited experience with UL94 and have not seen anything like this in our careers that total over 50 years together as A&P and IA.",,,,"Repair station Technician reported issues with UL94 aviation fuel dissolving cadmium and holding it in suspension; causing clogging of fuel system components.

An vibration was observed by the flight crew which went onto monitor as a result. When set down into ZZZ for troubleshooting; the item was rewritten back up but at a higher vibration amount than when it was placed on monitor. Engineering reviewed the data and determined that it was an indication issue and had the incorrect Technical Service Manual (TSM) procedure dictated to be done and regardless replace a vibration sensor; versus the correct TSM procedure. This dictation by engineering with maintenance lead to local maintenance to use the incorrect TSM at their request. The engine was placed back into service with just an idle run and nobody questioned to have a vibration survey completed to inspect for correction. The aircraft was dispatched with every flight afterwards reaching high vibrations and being signed off even though the indicated level was above the authority limit. Maintenance never issued a maintenance discrepancy to keep the aircraft at maintenance bases and the aircraft was flown to ZZZZ over water to its failure on departure from that station.The Company had created a culture where engineering will determine what needs to be done and cause deviations in correct and effective troubleshooting while maintenance will not challenge nor will the technicians involved. This adds to the reasons as to why the company has had a high engine fail rate. The propulsion engineers willfully dictate what needs to be done and it creates these deviations on required troubleshooting by licensed mechanics. There is too much office troubleshooting being accomplished without actually relying on correct or effective troubleshooting and it has created a motive to replace parts until the item is fixed. The company needs to stop relying on engineering as the main source of troubleshooting as this creates deviations plus actions placed into the web based system that are not the correct way to troubleshoot nor repair aircraft.

On the hydraulic synaptic page; the HYD 3 system was turning from green/amber and reporting 0% fluid. The QRH procedure was completed; and Dispatch notified of our situation. The decision was made that our destination (ZZZ) would be the best airport to land at. At that time; ZZZ2 was reporting light snow. We had roughly 50 minutes remaining in flight. We informed the cabin crew of our situation; briefed the passengers and then spent the remainder of the flight discussing how we were going to perform the landing under the circumstances. Pilot flying (PF) and pilot monitoring (PM) duties were switched due to pilot experience level in the aircraft. Upon switching to ZZZ Center; we informed ATC of our situation. The flaps 20 approach to ZZZ XXR was briefed between the pilots. During our descent; we elected to start the APU in case there was reason to shut down both engines in a hurry after landing. On short final we received some light turbulence and icing conditions. The Autopilot was disconnected once we had visual reference of the airport. The aircraft touched down with a slight crosswind from the right. Center line was maintained with rudder inputs; and thrust reversers (TR) activated. After the initial deceleration with TR; the brakes were utilized to slow the aircraft to a complete stop. The parking brake was engaged. The PM contacted the cabin crew to tell them to standby. We then contacted Tower and briefly spoke to Airport Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF) who was standing by.

I will fly for a long time and all of a sudden it is like somebody else is fighting me for the controls.What happened the last time was with no increase in wind the front props pitched up sending me to the rear. I counter acted that with full right stick forward; front pitch remained up and back pitch raised as well. This allowed me to inch forward at the same time the drone ascended a good 20 feet in the air with my fingers not even touching the yaw/elevation stick. I did manage to get it back to a safe landing area. I re-calibrated compass and gyro with the start up procedure again. I armed the props; took off and hovered at 10 feet for 1 minute and it was all good again. Needless to say this is an unsafe flight condition and it is a reoccurring problem.

We started up both engines and did before takeoff checklist at the gate to be ready for an immediate takeoff. As we were taxiing out; we were immediately given a takeoff. Runway change from XXL to XY. Taxi instructions were to go north on Taxiway 1; and then transit the terminal ramp via Taxiway 2 south on Taxiway 3 to runway XY. Well; Taxi north on Taxiway 1; we were advised to hold short for a aircraft departing runway XXL while simultaneously trying to turn; if our table height would be too high to transit below the bridge on the first terminal ramp. We were then instructed to take Taxiway 2; while the first officer was also working on new takeoff data for runway XY. We then move south on Taxiway 3 to runway XY. Taxiway 3 has a slight decline to the runway. In addition to the long taxi and the high pressure altitude; this led to a high rate temp situation in retrospect. Due to the high workload; this was not at top of mind. Upon reaching the runway tower; advised us that we were clear for takeoff. When we were retracting the landing gear; we were met with a hot brake temp switch icon; and ECAM message. As we receive this message; we were on the RNAV departure; heading westbound toward the mountains. The departure has an at or below crossing restriction at 10;000 feet at ZZZZZ. Immediately following that it has four at or above crossing restrictions to make sure that you easily cross the mountains. As we looked at the brake temperatures they were just at the threshold and most were below the 300 deg limitation. Given the congested airspace; and the high terrain the first officer and I elected to continue to climb and then lower the gear at flight level 260. During the climb the brake temperatures continue to decline. However; the HOT icon on the brake temperature switch continue to display. In order to extinguish the message the first officer and I decided to extend the landing gear and turn the brake fans on. After the hot icon was extinguished; we slowed down to 240 knots in order to retract the gear to comply with the VLO retraction limitation.After slowing to below 240; we began to notice that the low speed queue was exceeding 200 knots. Given our high altitude and excessive drag caused by the extended landing gear; I did not want to mess around with a potential performance issue at altitude over mountainous terrain and elected to put the gear up just under 240 knots. It has since come to my attention that the 240 knots was some measured speed away from the 0.53 MACH limitation and we exceeded that limitation.High altitude airport. Lack of situational awareness regarding brake temperatures. High altitude gear extension and retraction. Runway change. High terrain. Congested airspace. For starters; flying a high pressure; altitude in airports; requires more awareness to brake temperature monitoring. This would've probably been briefed had we anticipated a contingency of a longer taxi. However; we were advised a short taxi and so we neglected the effects of high pressure altitude have on our brakes temperatures. Perhaps a note for outbound aircraft could do well as a reminder to check temps before takeoff As we reviewed the QRH prior to commencing the checklist; it advised that we could delay landing gear attraction; if climb performance; and obstacle clearance permits. However; given our awareness of the crossing restrictions; the high terrain; and aircraft performance; we felt we could perform this checklist at a higher altitude. Perhaps a note highlighting the fact that Mach speeds will increase to a point that it will be difficult to retract the gear below the mach limitation might have been of some assistance. Maybe something like; at flight levels above FL230; gear retraction becomes difficult due to Mach limitation. Many limitations that have multiple speeds to comply with will specify whether the higher or lower limitation takes precedence with a phrase 'whichever is lower/higher.' With the absence of this phrase; it almost gives it the feeling of subjectivity. Maybe specifying would make it more clear in an abnormal situation.",,"We taxied from the ramp to runway XY. We had expected and briefed a much shorter taxi to XXL which ATC informed us was possible. But due to inbound traffic they made us go all the way to XY. I checked the brake temps before takeoff and they were all in the green. It was right before rotation I saw one brake on the right main gear switch to orange no the HOT indication illuminated. I delayed retracting the gear for 10-15 seconds to give them some more airflow. we had crossing traffic; ATC handover and crossing altitudes on the departure to make for the high terrain west of the airport; so I retracted the gear to ensure climb performance and focus on those other items. There was only 1 brake temp high and all the others were much cooler and well down in the green. We figured it was a faulty sensor on that wheel. We flew the departure with all the altitude constraints. Once we got out of the busiest area we discussed the brake temp. It was still reading 300 deg with the Hot light illuminated while all the rest of the gear were all indication the bottom of the temp range. Again we discussed it being a reading problem. We then decided to be certain the brake was cool that we would drop the gear. We figured at that altitude it would be very cold and the airstream would cool it quickly. We referenced the QRH for the procedure and followed the speeds. Below 270 we dropped them. We waited for several minutes for the brake temp indication do finally turn green even though it was below 280 deg. It finally cleared and we slowed to 240 to retract the gear. It was brought to my attention today that even though we followed the QRH speed of 240 for the retraction that we exceeded .53m. The cause of this error is the ambiguity in the QRH procedure. Usually speeds are defined for a procedure is indicated or Mach. If both are limiting then it is referenced as the high or the lower of Kias or Mach #. This procedure does to have any such reference. This QRH should have a note of verifying both speeds are met. It should expand on the effects of the procedure being done at altitude and the potential for missing the difference in speeds.",,"Air carrier flight crew reported exceeding gear down speed limitation due to a lack of details in the hot brake indication QRH procedure.",

I observed a direction sign indicating Taxiway Foxtrot on the south side of the runway and that exit has a large filet area and is designed for faster speeds; but I believe it does not meet the criteria of AC150/5300-13A. Regardless; the direction sign is located properly prior to the taxiway and is clearly visible. As we passed the direction sign and beginning of Taxiway Foxtrot on the south side; I began to locate Taxiway Foxtrot on the north side of the runway. As I was searching; I noted a dark; paved surface but could not locate a direction sign. I did note a black and yellow diagonally striped sign indicating an unusable surface. I continued to search for the turnoff and finally located Taxiway Foxtrot on the north side. We exited normally and proceeded to the gate.Upon block in; the initial hard surface I observed was the decommissioned Runway 6/24 and the pavement still exists. The unusable surface sign is unlit and is recessed back from the runway. No direction sign for Taxiway Foxtrot is located on the north side of the runway. I was expecting Taxiway Foxtrot much sooner on the north side as we had past the direction sign for the south side a few hundred feet prior. Upon further study; the direction sign on the south side is located approximately 750 ft prior to the taxiway on the north side. The combination of:1) The south side exit design compared to the 90 degree exit north.2) The large displacement of the western edge of the same taxiway.3) The presence of a hard surface north directly across from the start of the taxiway on the south.4) The recessed and unlit sign of the unusable pavement.5) The lack of a direction sign on the north side indicating Taxiway Foxtrot.6) Night conditions/low light.All led to a high workload situation and temporary questioning of the location of the briefed exit taxiway. In retrospect; the Jeppesen Chart has the closed runway marked and the taxiways depicted correctly. I did not study the subtleties of this intersection to the degree required to prepare for the unusual intersection.I do ask that the airport authority consider the possibilities of:1) Installing a direction sign on the north side of the runway.2) Light the unusable surface sign on the decommissioned Runway 6/24.3) Remove the dark pavement of the old Runway 6/24.4) Marry the exit design on both sides of the runway (I believe this may not be possible due to the close proximity of the ramp to Runway 11).5) Rename the taxiway on the north side vs. the south side.",,,,"Air carrier Captain reported difficulty finding taxiway Foxtrot after landing at MSY Runway 11 due to inadequate signage and poor markings.",

Preceding aircraft on same departure reported light turbulence in the climb. As a precaution the climb out was executed at 200K (turbulence speed at that altitude) in SPD mode with the autopilot engaged. After passing ZZZZZ (now in moderate turbulence) we received a stall warning and the autopilot disengaged. The airspeed fluctuated slightly at that time yet I did not observe an excessive speed decrease from 200K. I flew the airplane without autopilot for approximately a minute at an increased airspeed and then re-engaged the autopilot.

The flight originated from ZZZ under MVFR conditions. I did not file a flight plan. While enroute; ceilings were lower than I expected so I requested; and received; a pop up IFR clearance direct to C29. The flight enroute was uneventful. Upon contact with Madison Approach I requested the RNAV 28 approach into C29 and was told to expect the approach. I received a vector assignment of 050 degrees. At that time I assumed I would receive vectors to the final approach fix and set the GPS (Garmin 530) for vectors to final. I then received an altitude assignment that put me into actual IMC conditions. I was then approved for the RNAV 29 approach via the IAF EXIDE. This was my first time flying in the area and I had to confirm the IAF name. I received a vector to the IAF and while updating the GPS route I entered an unusual attitude. Once I recovered from the unusual attitude I already passed the IAF and instead of flying the appropriate approach via a course reversal I immediately turned inbound which took me out of the protected airspace and close to Madison (MSN). I then continued the approach without incident and cancelled my IFR flight plan in the air.",,,,"GA pilot reported a momentary loss of aircraft control while on the RNAV 28 approach to C29 airport in IMC conditions.",
