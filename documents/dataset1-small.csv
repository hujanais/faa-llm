Normal taxi; We departed Runway XX ZZZ. As TO power applied we began to notice burning oil smell on flight deck. I thought about rejecting but it was not my leg and this is not an uncommon thing and dissipates once engines are at pores for a moment. Continued TO and after rotation fumes continued and seemed to increase. Out of 1500 I told ZZZ Tower Controller we were having a fume event and needed an immediate return. I did not declare emergency since there was no visible smoke. We were handed to ZZZ TRACON Departure; turned at 3000 ft. Downwind for Runway XY. I dinged Cabin and asked if they smelled anything; the response was no. I told them we would be returning to ZZZ and they had 10 minutes; let me know if they see anything. During this time odor continued. Didn't get any better. We accomplished after After TO ck; cruz; descent ck and a quick set up and brief of ILS Runway XY. weather was CAVOK. We were over landing weight and deployed Gear and flaps in downwind to burn fuel. I did a rough and dirty calc and figured we would be at landing weight at touchdown. I sent acars to Dispatch and called gate freq in ZZZ to tell them we would need a gate right away.   FO (First Officer) landed perfectly smooth touch. I noted we had touched at 450# over MAX landing weight.  We taxied to fast to gate. I started APU for electric and shut down the Left engine and the result was increase in fumes. We pulled into gate and shut down RH engine and went on APU air. The fumes subsided and I suspect it was the RH engine dumping oil into the bleed air to the pack. Maintenance arrived and Mechanic said he smelled the oil as he entered the plane. Post flight I spoke with ALL the flight attendants and the rear positions said they had strong fumes. The #1 on call said there were no fumes. Some people simply have bad smell? IDK.  A cursery review of the aircraft past history indicated high oil consumption of the RH engine. I had noted this and it was included in my preflight threat assessment briefing to the FO. I did not declare an emergency as the traffic at the airport was not heavy and my priority was getting on the ground ASAP. It was extremely high workload and I commend the FO for the teamwork. I think we covered the bases and actually had to extend the downwind an extra minute to get finished. The Tower was aware of the situation and I assume an alert 1 was issued. I felt further distraction of declaration was not helpful. I fully blame Company maintenance procedures for not identifying and repairing the high oil consumption on the RH engine. They dispatched an aircraft with an ongoing defect. Jets are not Piston engines and high oil consumption should not be deferred and dispatched.Tricresyl phosphate when burned and introduced into cabin can kill. The Airline has a fume event reporting policy and has taken adequate steps to report the downline event reporting. I feel Maintenance diminishes the serious nature of fumes in the cabin. This aircraft should have not been dispatched with high oil burn.",,,,"Air Carrier Captain reported a burning oil odor during takeoff and initial climb which prompted the flight crew to request an immediate return to departure airport.

The following is a narrative of events in a linear flow but during the event a lot was happening at the same time.During cruise at FL360; Captain; PF (Pilot Flying); we had an Autopilot Disconnect Warning. I grabbed the yolk and throttles and checked PFD. Captain's PFD showed we were white across the board. Manual on speed; altitude and heading. We were in a slight decent and airspeed was slowing into the lower ft. FO (First Officer) was showing slight decent and airspeed increasing. I made the statement it looked like Airspeed Unreliable. We then had Multiple Level 2 Alerts pop up. We then started to get Over Speed Warnings. We determined that it looked like the FO's info was the more accurate and I slowed down just enough to discontinue the Over Speed Warning. Captain's Airspeed was continuing to decrease (showing 180 kts). I directed the FO to look at the first few steps of one of the 3 Level 2 Alerts. I said the checklist should have a statement that if we have the 3 Level 2 alerts showing it is an Airspeed Unreliable. We confirmed that was correct and started the Airspeed Unreliable checklist.At some point ATC called us and we confirmed we were having major issues. We told them we were correcting to altitude and course. We also said we would get back to them.While the FO started the checklist I was back on altitude and trying to correct to course. I was having trouble getting on course. I then realized that my side was commanding a heading to course based on incorrect winds. My airspeed was down to 80 kts. and showing a wind out of the southeast at over 200 kts. FO was showing winds near flight planned approximately 180 degrees and 120 kts. I contacted ATC and told them we were lost a lot of info and would like a heading. He gave us a heading and offered ZZZ for the nearest airport. I told him we would get back to him.During the Airspeed Unreliable checklist; it showed that our aircraft was equipped with an AUX CADC. Per the checklist we selected it to the Captain's Side. We finished the checklist and got back almost everything we had lost except: SEL FADEC ALT Level 2 was still showing on all 3 engines. We ran the QRH and corrected that Warnings.The only Warning still showing was an ALT Comparator Alert. We discussed the weather at ZZZ1 and felt that with weather at 1;500 ft. we could make a safe ILS approach. Captain's; FO's and Standby Altimeter were all with in 150 ft.We then contacted Dispatch and told them what we had. We also confirmed with them our plan to continue to ZZZ. They saw no problems with continuing to ZZZ.",,"During cruise at FL360; the Autopilot disconnected. Captain was Pilot Flying and grabbed the controls. My instruments showed us in a descent with increasing airspeed. Captain's instruments were showing a descent and his airspeed was decreasing. Captain said that it looked like an unreliable airspeed. My instruments started showing an overspeed condition; and we started getting the associated warning with that. We also had multiple level 2 Alerts displayed so I started the checklist for the Select FADEC ALT (The first Level 2 Alert displayed); which along with the other Level 2 Alerts; directed me to the Unreliable Airspeed checklist; which I began. At that time we determined that it was my side's instruments that were correct; due to their correlation to the standby instruments. The Captain's Airspeed Indication dropped to as low as 90 kts. Captain then slowed down to stop the Over Speed. ATC queried us about being off on our altitude and I told them that we were working an instrumentation issue but we were working on getting back on course and altitude and we would get back with them. Captain was trying to maintain course towards the fix; but because of his incorrect data we were not going the right direction. We requested a heading assignment from ATC while we continued to work the issue; which they gave us. At some point around this time; ATC offered us ZZZ as the nearest airport if we needed to divert. The checklist directed us to switch the AUX CADC to the Captain's side. When we did that his airspeed data returned to normal. The Select FADEC ALTN level 2 Alert was still Illuminated; so we ran that checklist and it cleared the Alert. We were able to get back on course and reengage the Autopilot after that. The only remaining issue was an Altitude Comparison Advisory; because there was about a 150 ft. difference between my and the Captain's Altitude reading. We discussed how to proceed and neither one of us thought that the small altitude split would prevent safely continuing to ZZZ1; so we continued. We contacted company as well and they saw no issue with continuing on to ZZZ1. Remainder of the flight continued without incident.I believe this event was caused by the Captain's pitot tube becoming blocked by ice crystals; as we were in the tops of clouds at high altitude for an extended period of time. This caused the loss of useful airspeed data on his side; which caused the autopilot disconnect; leading the Captain to attempt to maintain proper speed; course and altitude with bad airspeed data.",,"MD-11 flight crew reported an Autopilot Disconnect Warning in cruise. This was followed by numerous Airspeed Warnings. The flight crew ran the QRH and elected to continue to destination airport.",

On the climb out (900 ft. AGL) the PM (Pilot Monitoring) IRS system completely failed. The PF (Pilot Flying) (mine) IRS continued to operate for a bit but also eventually failed and disconnected the Auto Pilot. We alerted departure to the loss of instrumentation and requested a vector. Using the magnetic compass and standby ISI we leveled off at 5;000 ft. and flew the vector. Shortly after we requested a climb to 10;000 ft. to leave the IMC conditions and to better run our QRH/Checklist. We soon realized the failure and decided that a return to ZZZ was the best option. The clouds were high enough for an eventual visual approach. ATC gave us a no gyro approach until we were able to get the ILS GS and then runway insight to land. Upon landing there was no further action required beyond returning to a gate and alerting Maintenance. We are unsure of the cause for the failure. The only reason we had to return is both systems fully failed.There is not much we can do about the failure.

As instructor; I immediately informed Tower traffic was in sight and currently was passing directly over top of us. The high wing Cessna had departed the parallel runway; Runway 30R; on an extended upwind and just entering left traffic ahead of us; per ATC; but appeared to have continued their turn from upwind to downwind instead of flying a crosswind leg. Tower did inform the high wing Cessna after passing they had to widen their downwind because they turned into upwind traffic on the parallel. No other conflicts occurred. From my position in the low wing Piper; the high wing Cessna appeared to be about 400 feet above us when passing over top.As a result; I discussed with my student that even though we both were listening to the ATC Traffic advisory and scanning for that traffic; to not let that interrupt our situational awareness of traffic on the parallel runway. Despite this incident both aircraft being on same frequency; it is possible they can be on different frequencies. Both the student and instructor learned about the requirements of situational awareness; and to yes look for traffic ATC points out; but keep that scan going being careful not to expect to see that traffic cross in front of us. While we were still on our straight out instruction from ATC initially; situational awareness is key with parallel runways; especially at airports where it is common for ATC to assign that aircraft left traffic for that runway even though it doesn't follow published pattern directions. It's still possible for traffic to cross ahead of or behind you in the crosswind legs. My student and I were able to take the appropriate actions to avoid any further loss of separation and avoid a collision after visually acquiring the traffic.",,,,"GA instructor pilot reported an NMAC with another aircraft in the pattern which did not follow ATC instructions.",

It was communicated ZZZ could not take us and we needed to advise an alternate. ZZZ1 was chosen. It was communicated we would be number 6 or 7 into ZZZ1 and an air carrier flight just went missed. Numerous changes in heading and hand offs to other Controllers shortly followed. While expecting to still be number 6 or 7 on approach we were vectored through final for the RNAV XX to Runway XX. A intercept vector was given followed by an unexpected clearance for the approach. We were mindful of the 3000 ft. mandatory altitude on the approach and received a low altitude alert from ATC at 3200 ft.

There was problem starting the engine that was felt to be secondary to a hot start. After an uneventful run up; I departed Runway XX with vectors. I noted a low voltage indicator but normal amps shortly after departure during my climb. Initially; I thought it was increasing but then indicated decreasing voltage. I notified ATC that I would like to divert to ZZZ2 which was the closest airport and in visual but I did not request priority handling. I performed the electrical failure checklist with no resolution. There was precipitous loss of radios. I circled to lose altitude; let the Tower prepare by way of other traffic and use alternate procedures to get the landing gear down. It was a normal landing. The root cause was a loose alternator belt.",,,,"Pilot reported Alternator Failure during climb. Subsequently; all communications were lost. The pilot diverted to make a precautionary landing.",

The icing was a result of rain from the previous day that had frozen over night. I would like to emphasize that all of the ice was removed during the pre-flight phase.During takeoff; after rotating and becoming airborne; and while increasing airspeed; there was a violent fluttering of the flight controls observed that negatively affected the controllability of the aircraft. The effects were severe enough that I do not believe that we would have been able to successfully complete an entire lap in the traffic pattern to land back at the airport. Fortunately; the runway was long enough that we were able to make a successful landing on the remaining runway and terminate the flight without further incident.It was concluded after the flight that the most likely cause was that some of the rain from the day before had made its way into some of the flight control surfaces and caused the fluttering once we reached a high enough airspeed for the imbalance to cause the fluttering. After temperatures warmed up above freezing; the airplane was flown again without issue.My biggest issue with this occurrence is that there is really no way to check for icing inside of the control surfaces on any airplane that I have ever flown. As far as I'm aware; the only way to detect this issue is to fly the airplane and observe the fluttering. Proper corrective action if this is observed in the future would be to abort the takeoff; if able; and if unable to abort; reduce to an airspeed that prevents the fluttering and return to land at or below that particular airspeed.",,,,"Instructor pilot reported violent flight control fluttering after takeoff and elected to land on the remaining runway rather than chance a flight around the pattern. The aircraft had been deiced prior to takeoff.",
